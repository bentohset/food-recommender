Oven & Fried Chicken,"Tried the original and spicy garlic chicken  Spicy garlic is a little too sweet for me but the spiciness is definitely on point. Seasoning for the original flavour is good but it can be more juicy, the texture is not as good as before.  Totally disappointed with the steam egg, it is over seasoned, undercooked as it is not charred enough and with the amount of broth underneath it is as good as drinking egg soup.  Service wise is average, the staff can be more friendly but understand that they are lack of manpower too.  Overall, it is a pleasant place to dine in but food quality definitely has lot of room to improve."
Oven & Fried Chicken,"This place gets busy, but it's for a good reason. The chicken is the main attraction but please don't overlook the sides. They offer a tossed salad with yogurt that I never knew that I needed in my life."
Oven & Fried Chicken,"If you are on the hunt for the best fried chicken in Singapore, you cannot give OFC a miss!  Had their original flavor chicken and it was hot, crispy and juicy at the same time. It was beautifully seasoned and the chicken juices just flows with every bite.  Special shout out to their kimchi soup as well. Was pleasantly surprised by how full bodied it tastes. You can have either tuna or pork to go with it and I chose the tuna. The tuna smell was strong, yet not overpowering!  It was a hearty bowl of soup."
Oven & Fried Chicken,"The age old golden combination of beer and fried chicken. If macdonald's and KFC serves up alcohol then maybe they might've scored as high.  We had the pleasure of coming in early and getting placement in a semi-private area. Really nice.  The fried chicken is excellent with a hint of sweetness. We had the soy fried chicken which was crisp yet dripping with sweet goodness. On the flip side, the signature crunch chicken (read: oven fried?) was rather mediocre. It felt weird to eat fried chicken with the flavor profile of plain toast (it's not bad, but it's not great either). Maybe the yangyoum would've tasted better, but unfortunately we didn't have the space to try it. Also comes with complimentary pickled radish and garlic-flavored crackers.  Service was really, really responsive.  Bottom line for us is to stick to the fried chicken and you won't be disappointed. It's a tried and tested experience and we'll be back for more."
Oven & Fried Chicken,"Friday night super crowded Roasted chicken, original wings, cheesy rice cake, kimchi stew. Peach flavoured rice wine. Sides include crackers and radish cubes. Nice place to hang with friends Great vibes"
Oven & Fried Chicken,"First experience here was 10/10! Staffs were friendly, attentive and you could really see that they are hardworking too! Staffs shows and give their best to serve the customers especially one of the guy staff, great job!!  We ordered the half boneless soy sauced baked and fried chicken (8pcs) was good enough to feel 2adults and 1 young toddler. Really juicy and tender too!  We also had the tteokbokki which was lovely too although, we felt like there's too much sauce /soup bcz the kind we usually have usually gives a just nice amount of sauce enough to cover the food. Overall, food was superb and will definitely come back again for more!!!"
Oven & Fried Chicken,"I just want to say that I rarely write google reviews, but I want to write this one because my experience here was great due to our server. I came here because the reviews were good. And they were right. The food was good but Pierre’s attitude elevated my entire experience. He was super attentive, kind and cheerful. Would 10/10 come again if he was my server!  Food taste wise, I feel it’s quite authentic and although the pricing was steeper than others, the portions were generous. chicken was nice and crispy, the soups were flavourful. Though you can miss out the ramen as its pretty similar to maggi hahah.. But overall experience was good. Our favourite thing was the fish cake as it reminded us of Korea.."
Oven & Fried Chicken,"Out of the traditional Korean chicken. This place serves oven baked chicken that is surprisingly crunchy. Service was great! It’s just that, pricing could improve."
Oven & Fried Chicken,"Packs well for takeaway,  without chicken getting soggy. Had the Fried chicken which had good crunch, and the yang nyeom chicken that was evenly coated, with mild spicy chosen. Overall efficient and fast service."
Oven & Fried Chicken,"For 6 pax dinner, we ordered tteokbokki, korean omelette, 2 kinds of half portion chicken (soy wings and fried chicken), herbal chicken soup (whole) and bulgogi. Managed to finish most of it except 2-3 pieces of chicken.  Tteokbokki was mildly spicy and sweet, love its cheesy touch to it. Half portion soy wings (7pcs) and wow they were very well seasoned! Fried chicken definitely takes the cake, tender and flavorful! The best I've had in ages.  Herbal soup was on the milder side so it may not sit well with some diners. Personally I prefer this ""blander"" version. Chicken was quite tender and easy to separate from the bones.  The Bulgogi was pretty good, we had to ask for another serving of lettuce as the combination of garlic, green chilli, chill sauce really makes the meat tastier by a notch.  Service staff were extremely attentive even when they seemed shorthanded especially when they had to juggle between appeasing the bunch of grab riders (there was a surge of orders and dine-in customers at the same time, we overheard that the grab orders were stopped to prioritise dine-in) and serving the diners."
Oven & Fried Chicken,"Can't go wrong with the fried chicken.:poultry_leg: The seafood pancake was surprisingly very nice. Crispy exterior, slightly chewy pancake, and it was not greasy. Personally do not recommend the fish egg soup. Little ingredients with tough vegetable and too spicy to my liking."
Oven & Fried Chicken,"Came here obviously for the Korean Fried Chicken, 5 stars because the taste is very similar to Korea! Both original and yangnyeom are super good. We can also order half-half. Will definitely visit again."
Oven & Fried Chicken,"Great place for supper in the west and they have great Korean Fried chicken! It's not oily but really crispy and great taste. Been here a few times already and always have been satisfied with the food here, staff here are super attentive and the atmosphere is chill and casual. The army stew is only okay though. Come here for supper since they open till late!"
Oven & Fried Chicken,"Original fried chicken was really tasty. Wouldn't recommend the sauced options though, they were kinda cloying after a while and the flavour wasn't amazing.  Tteokbokki was soft without much chew but the sauce was alright. Quite pricey though"

Oven & Fried Chicken,":poultry_leg::shallow_pan_of_food: Food & Taste: Excellent Korean fried chicken. One of the best I would say. The fried chicken tasted very fresh. Crispy and fragrant on the outside, while being so moist and tender on the inside. The serving portion for half is quite generous. Ordered the seafood pancake and it was also good! The pancake light, thin and crispy on the outside but once you bit into it, you will notice it is quite generously stuffed with ingredients. Every bite you taste seafood, either the little prawns or squid pieces.  :round_pushpin: Place: Very easy to find since it is located along the road going to Mount Austin. There is alot of parking available as well. Seats are very spacious.  :person_in_tuxedo_light_skin_tone: Service: Good service staff. We went in the late morning so the place was just opening. Saw the staff diligently cleaning the store front. They were all very polite and welcoming. After ordering, they served us the condiments that goes with our dishes and the water very promptly. Food was also prepared promptly and well.  :money_bag: Price: Reasonable for such great chicken The fried chicken (half portion) was about 27RM and the seafood pancake was 26RM  :hatching_chick:Waiting Time: Hardly any waiting time because the staff were all very prompt in serving us.  Would definitely come back again for the excellent food and customer service!"
Oven & Fried Chicken,"A very memorable Korean fried chicken experience! Even though we can't finish our fried chicken, it still tasted good after reheat in oven. The pickled radish is amazing"
Oven & Fried Chicken,"Fantastic service. The fried chickens are so good and juicy. We had original fried chicken and Yang nyeom fried chicken (half each) for 6 pax. We also ordered a mixed seafood pancake and jabche. On top of these, we had 2 soju and 4 hire beer. Just nice for all of us. The staff are so nice and generous. We had free flow prawn crackers. They even gave us free Korean style omelette and Korean soya milk. We were so happy with our dinner. Thanks so much for the service!"
Oven & Fried Chicken,"Honestly we had high expectations for the food but it wasn't that good. We ordered some chicken fries , kimchi fried rice and others but unfortunately it wasnt that good to our taste. This place was highly recommended to us by others so thats why we went there un the first place. It might still be good for others but in my case it wasn't."
Oven & Fried Chicken,"My food expectation is low, the food was terrible... staff is friendly, so probably come here for drinks ;)"
O Chicken & Beer,Had very nice dining experience here. Ordered the garlic chicken with French fries set. I must say the cheese stick were fried in old oil. So it didn't taste good.  The rest of the fried stuff is OK. Also ordered the sweet spicy chicken. We think this is nicer than the garlic soy chicken  they are also generous with the sides.
O Chicken & Beer,"A gem at Boat Quay,added in my go to place for Korean food. Love d food,atmosphere..Have sitting arrangement both indoor nd outdoor.. Amazing complimentary items(they even refill).. Will be an injustice if I don't mention the hospitality..Lovely service by the friendly staffs..  A 5 * from me:thumbs_up_light_skin_tone::thumbs_up_light_skin_tone:"
O Chicken & Beer,"We went on Saturday at 6pm. It was quite empty and only few tables were occupied. We ordered half chicken, kimchi pancake, and kimchi stew. We were served with side dishes and all of them tasted delicious. The food portions were quite large for two persons. Our favourite was the kimchi stew, its spicy and delicious. Do skip the kimchi pancake, it was so so."
O Chicken & Beer,"There are three groups of people in line ahead of me, and I was told that the wait time is about an hour. I was stunned and double-checked with the staff to make sure I hadn't misheard him. This eatery restaurant offers both indoor and outdoor seating. I've been waiting for 45 minutes to be seated. Cold radish, kim chi, spicy bean curd, and crackers were served.  I asked about their recommendations, what their specialty was and what people typically ordered? Therefore, I went with the recommendation. 1.Half boneless chicken $28.80++ You can choose 2 flavors quarterly. I choose original and soy sauce) 2.Kimchi pancake $23.80++ 3.Sundobo Jjigae $19.80++ 4.Lemon Juice $5.80++  I'm quite impressed that the food was ready in ten minutes. Let's start with their signature fried chicken. The chicken portion is quite generous, soft and tender, and perfectly fried until crispy. It is, however, flavorless. It's simply fried chicken. The pancake portion is larger than my face, the thickness is perfect, and it's crispy. Seafood soup was served in hot stone, there’s tofu, mussels, small prawn and enoki mushroom. Very homey and comforting meal. Lemon juice does not taste like it looks; it is slightly sweeter.  Will I visit again? Both yes and no. Waiting time is slightly longer, but they do not limit the amount of time you can spend in the restaurant; you can chill and relax with your friends without interruption. However, you may end up waiting even longer to be seated, and it is quite noisy to converse. If there isn't a line and I'm in the mood for hot soup, I'll definitely return for their seafood soup.  Total bill $99.75"
O Chicken & Beer,"Been here twice. Their tofu pork is the bomb! Not sure why noone mentioned about their tofu pork, it is definitely a must try dish. Everything was great, just hoping that the aircon is cooler."
Kko Kko Nara,"Authentic Korean flavour through and through! Initially a little bit hesitant to come here as the prices felt slightly higher than the other shops but wow after eating the food, we were not disappointed at all!  Fried chicken was so freshly cooked, I can still taste the crispiness of the batter and the strong flavouring!  Soup was so thick that there wasn’t much soup and the flavour was so strong and delicious! Definitely somewhere I would come again!"
Kko Kko Nara,"Unlike most of the other Korean restaurants along the stretch that is largely BBQ, this place is one if you do not want to smell or here for a date. This decent restaurant serves pretty wide selection to choose from. The ones we ordered were in fact all delicious. The restaurant also has a nice cozy feel and not too noisy, for a nice catchup with friends when u can really hear the conversation. :squinting_face_with_tongue:"
Kko Kko Nara,"Would recommend the seafood pancake, soft and crispy. Their sides were well presented and I like the pickled radish but their kimchi was a little bland in my opinion. Ordered their fried chicken and it was nice, but the kitchen or staff seemed to have forgotten our order and we had to wait longer than expected to receive our food. Fried octopus was a little chewy so it was a little tough to eat. Tea and water was complimentary and you can get a free ice cream upon leaving too (common in many Korean restaurants)."
Kko Kko Nara,"Soy garlic chicken flavour was good, however the pieces were really really small. One of the smallest Korean fried chicken pieces I’ve eaten.  Raw marinated crab was amazing! Flavour was good, no fishy smell. It came with 3 crabs, size was reasonable. Understood that previously you could upsize to a medium one, but now it’s just one size. Order a plain white rice to go with it. As it can be quite salty after awhile.  Went on a weekday dinner and it can also get slightly crowded."
Kko Kko Nara,Very poor dining experience especially the Samgyetang.. Serve instant ready to eat kind with 2 red dates and spring onions? God knows the rest of the soups they served are all from ready to eat ones u can purchase from Korean supermarkets? U can do better than that. Chicken wings were small and skinny. Not worth the price paid…
Kko Kko Nara,"Pretty got weekday set lunch menu with a few good choices. Really like the side dishes are they are quite generously portioned and given. Don't expect like wow Korean food as you get what you pay for. Don't think I will try any BBQ here so just the set lunch or soupy stuff. Service was so so, staff are just like there really to bring you the food, since you are using QR to order..so nothing much else...but sometimes I wonder why we still have to pay for service charge where we order via QR, walk to counter to pay etc. but I know the service charge don't really go to the staff...oh wells...."
Kko Kko Nara,Here for their very affordable lunch promotion. Kimchi stew was not just aromatic but was surprised by the portions of pork belly inside. And topping off with a jewel vortex view while dining. Staff was vigilant and swift.
Kko Kko Nara,"Had a really nice dinner here & the non-grilled meat portions are huge (glass noodles, beef bulgogi)! We ordered the grilled beef ribs but forgot to take a pic, small portion & around $40+. Most of their grilled meats are around that range & the portion is around 100g I think. We also order a kimchi pancake which I didn't get to take a pic of, but it was very nice. Not a wide variety of sides but all are refillable & addictive!"
Kko Kko Nara,The service was good and the sides tasted great. But their grilled beef was a huge disappointment. It was so tough and dry that I had a sore jaw after finishing up the beef. I don’t recommend dining at this resturant.
Kko Kko Nara,"3 star rating as the lights were automatically turned off at 7:30pm for the light show at the fountain  Whole restaurant at the outdoor area where we sat was pitch black  Would had asked to sit inside if we had known  Side dishes were delicious, friendly staff"
Ah Tan Wings,"A shop specialising in chicken wings should be good. Afterall your focus is only on one SKU.  However Ah Tan wings are just average. Nothing memorable about them and in fact found them a wee bit too salty.  It's not terrible or bad, but it's just a plate of wings that will satiate you but not leave you coming back. At least that's what happened for my family and I. Everytime we visit Yishun Park, we wouldn't make it a point where we have to die die order this. So I guess it says a lot about these wings. They are great to accompany other foods, but definitely not a necessity.  @goodfoodwrite - instagram & YouTube"
Ah Tan Wings,"This is really the best Har Cheong Gai Prawn Paste Chicken that I ever had in Singapore. Comes with incredible amount of flakes. Extremely crunchy and flavourful. The chicken cutlet and the wings are both super juicy. Egg with rice and Chilli, you nailed it!"
Ah Tan Wings,"After almost a year gap, finally give it another try since the boss is back. And the Q looks long.  Well, although much better than a year ago but the chicken was not those freshly fried type... no the type of oil juicy type of bite you expecting."
Ah Tan Wings,"They fried the chicken on the spot upon ordering, thus its very good.  They aced all 3 important portions for the meal - rice, chicken and chilli."
Ah Tan Wings,Orders 2 set A. One of the set add egg and add wing. Repeat myself a few times to the auntie when ordering. She still take a while to confirm with me my order again before keying in the order.  Paid extra $2.20 for the wing but end up she never packed for me.
Chir Chir,"Crispy chicken with mustard and salsa - 4 stars Good flavour, not sweet. Juicy with a crisp batter. The salsa that came with it was my favourite, but they gave a tiny portion. The server (with gelled back hair) walked past with a gigantic tub of salsa so I asked if I could have more. He said it only came with one portion. For $35 for the plate of tenders this seems rather ridiculous. I offered to pay for it and he still refused. Seems like really poor company policy if it really is. Docked stars for the poor service."
Chir Chir,"Google shown the closing hour is 9.30pm. When we reached at 8pm we were told that the restaurant is closing at 9pm. If there is a change in the operating hour, it should be updated. We made our way to Somerset only to find out that we have only less than an hour to dine. We felt that staff is rushing us to quickly finish our meal. Overall, we didnt enjoy the whole experience. Chir Chir used to be one of my go to place for korean fried chicken fix but after today experience, i will not want to go back. A few of the dishes that we would like to order was unavailable. Not sure if it is because we reached at 8pm or it is always unavailable. The honey butter chicken is the worst dish ever!!! I DO NOT RECOMMEND The Honey Butter Chicken. It used to be quite tasty with real honey and butter now it is replaced with some honey flavoured powder which smell and taste AWFUL. The spicy toppoki is not bad and the garlicky chicken with the cheese dip is not bad. Price wise its too pricey given that the quality of food is below average. Overall experience, sucks! Definitely not going back."
Chir Chir,"Came on a Wednesday night for dinner with a friend for our Korean Chicken fix and it was pretty alright. Store had only 3 full tables. There was only 1 service staff on the ground and the remaining are kitchen staffs. Water is not complimentary.  :cheese_wedge: Mac & Cheese was a very good purchase. We ordered a regular and went for seconds with a Large. Flavours wise is towards the milky side, topped with shredded cheese, the heat from mixing made it extra gooey and stretchy. Loved it and pretty sure kids would love it too. I rate: 4.5/5 :glowing_star:  :poultry_leg: Went for seconds on the chicken as well. Had Soy Garlic and Spicy Soy halves and it was so crunchy even though drenched with sweet and savory sauce. The addition of fried tteokbokki and sweet potatoes (+$2) was not a good choice. Carby and hard to bite. Would love it if the white vinegar cubed radish was given as a side to cleans our palates and to finish off the ultimate korean chicken experience. Other than those 2 issues, the chicken was great and I rate: 4/5 :glowing_star:  Feedback: Did not appreciate the payment system where everything from menu browsing, ordering, member subscription, and even including payment is in app. It is quite user unfriendly for those who are not comfortable with sharing their personal details like credit card number and contact details... it kinda defeats the purpose of service charge when everything is self-service, no? :unamused_face: Would like it if payment option offline could be made available. Because upon exiting the shop, obviously, there is a payment counter."
Chir Chir,First time trying chir chir here during a weekday lunch. The lunch set suppose to come with fries and kimchi but I can’t find where is the kimchi. Trying to ask the staff but the staff is forever busy. The curry crispy chicken is very good. The crispy chicken is juicy and crispy. Thumbs up for the food but the service can be improved.
Chir Chir,"Ordered the spicy chicken fondue. The chicken taste quite fresh. Spicy sauce was not spicy. Tastes more like that sweet thai sauce. But the cheese was decadent. With its rich cheesy taste, I feel the calories of each scoop.  I can finish a whole rack of ribs by myself, but can only afford to finish half of the chicken here, and I did not touch the toppoki. I had to peel of the chicken skin and abstain from the cheese to persevere for the second half of the meal. I recommend this meal for sharing."
Chir Chir,"Visited chir chir chicken at Bugis the other day! The food was good, we ordered the rose cheese chiqueen - crispy chicken tenders in a creamy mix of mozzarella and fondue cheese :drooling_face::drooling_face: The portion was big, and probably meant for 2-3 to share. We also ordered the half portion of spicy yangnyeom. It was a generous plate of delicious hot crispy chicken in a sweet spicy sauce, very tasty :) will definitely be back to try their other dishes!"
Chir Chir,"The food was very filling and tasty, one of the most flavourful korean/fried chicken I have tasted so far. We ordered the Rose Cheese Chiqueen as the main dish, paired with the cooling and refreshing Passion Yellow Tok Tok as well as a side of Original Mac & Cheese (Single)"
Chir Chir,"Chir Chir: Tucked away on the food street on level 2, it is quite convenient to locate. The soy chicken ordered is crispy and tender, whilst hints of sweet soy sauce/almond flakes and chili flakes are complementing the chicken. Mac and Cheese mehish, albeit more wallet friendly with the beer set."
Chir Chir,"Great fried chickens. The noodle in the soup base is chewy, like the Chinese style potato floor noodle. Half for each type is good portioning of two. Less vegetables to choose from."
Chir Chir,"Had a fantastic dinner at the Bugis Junction outlet. There is a wide variety of fried chicken that we were able to select from.  The staff was helpful and recommended the dishes for us. We decided to order the Garlic Soy Sauce Chicken, Spicy Chicken and the Mac n Cheese  Overall, the chicken was still crispy even after coating it with the sauce. The Mac n Cheese had a generous amount of cheese added, which was good!"
Twins Korean Restaurant,"Fun place for fried chicken and beers. Loved the ice cream beer (aka frozen foam). Very neat concept. The chicken was great - you can get almost anything deboned which is awesome. I think we liked the cheese the best, but the garlic soy was lovely as well."
Twins Korean Restaurant,"We randomly chanced upon this when searching for good Korean food on Google so we decided to come here for dinner. Although we made reservations, it seems like the restaurant is relatively quiet during weekday nights (we came on a Tuesday night) - but nevertheless just make reservations in case things change!  We ordered a bowl of Jjamppong and got the original fried chicken to share (attached is the menu to see the different options). Portion is decent but the food was SUPER good! Honestly, the chicken batter was perfect and it was neither too oily or salty for our liking. The jjamppong wasn't too spicy or bland - just the right balance too. They even had a decent serving of seafood.  There was only one service staff member at that time and she was super professional and smiley when taking our orders and paying the bill. The overall vibes was really cool too, with Korean music playing in the background (not too loud so you can have proper conversations without shouting at the top of your voice). All in all, I would 10/10 recommend anyone looking for good authentic Korean food in Tanjong Pagar. It is a short walk from both Outram Park and Tanjong Pagar MRT stations."
Twins Korean Restaurant,"There were 3 of us, we ordered a 4 pcs chicken wings, kimchi pancake and budae jiggae along with non-alcoholic drinks.  Per pax around $40  We went on a Monday night, it was pretty empty, no reservations needed. The food was just alright, nothing fancy or to rave about.  I'll probably try other Korean restaurants along the streets"
Twins Korean Restaurant,"Original boneless chicken with onion sauce ($24++ = $28) - 2.5 stars Enough for one person though I'm probably not a bit eater. But this made me question whether KFC really is just overpriced Kentucky Fried Chicken. The chicken was kind of ordinary, although I imagine it had more meat than you'd find at Kentucky FC (and I haven't been there in years). But the issue was probably the onion sauce, which tasted like fairly artificial and processed mustard. I much preferred the fresh Pico de gallo-like onion sauce at Chir Chir. Would not pay $28 for this again.  ======  Boneless chicken with sweet and spicy and rice cakes - 4.5 stars The boneless chicken was juicer than the bone-in chicken surprisingly. My husband, who usually prefers the latter said he would just order the boneless chicken the next time. It was my second time having Korean fried chicken - given that the last time I had something similar was probably KFC popcorn chicken decades ago, I was pleasantly surprised that there was ample meat and not just a bunch of fried batter. I liked this sauce better than the soy garlic one but it was definitely sweet and towards the end I didn't quite enjoy the sweetness. We got the medium and it was larger than we expected.  Soy garlic 6 piece - 4.25 stars Sweet sauce and could barely taste the garlic.  Good place for Korean fried chicken, but personally I think the sauces are too sweet for me."
Twins Korean Restaurant,"Came here with my colleagues after watching a tiktok video about this place. We had high hopes since it looked really good in the video.  Utterly disappointed. Although it may be $10 nett for the lunch set I highly DO NOT recommend this place.  Thing is Tanjong Pagar is full of good Korean places to eat and one of the signature things about Korean places is? Banchan right? This place gave zero banchan. I may have bought the set and $10 nett no banchan I can still tahan.  My friend bought their kimchi pork fried rice ala carte and she got zero banchan and had to pay $20 for just a bowl of rice that tasted meh. She could have went down the street elsewhere with banchan and where the food taste better and is around the same price.  Another thing, this place is NOT eco friendly. It is a restaurant but they serve the lunch set in dapao container even when you are dining in and they use disposable chopstick as well. Side tracking their spoon is not even the Korean spoon though its metal spoon.  I would have much rather paid $20 for my meal and went to Obba or Wang Dae Bak where the food actually makes me feel satiated and where there is banchan provided.  The only thing that I liked about this place was their boneless fried chicken with the powder cheese. It came out piping hot, super crispy and yummy. That is pretty much the only reason why I actually gave the food a one star rating. My friends gave this place zero stars (savage).  My advice? Take your money and go elsewhere. Tanjong Pagar is full of good Korean food stalls. You just anyhow throw a stone and you will surely find a Korean store better than this one."
Waker Chicken,"Korean fried chicken in a coffee shop. Queue was really long, waited for quite some time. Chicken was nicely fried and crispy. No red meat on the bones as well. I would try the sweet and spicy chicken, and soy one. Original chicken could use a bit more seasoning."
Waker Chicken,"Tried the original crispy, taste wise its normal nothing too crazy. Just a little off in the seasoning, could be saltier. $14.30 (30 cents takeaway) for 7 pieces is quite pricy considering the size of the chicken being relatively small."
Waker Chicken,"Hands down, this place serves the best fried chicken ever! I'm not exaggerating when I say that it's truly a culinary masterpiece. The chicken is incredibly juicy, bursting with flavor in every bite. It's the epitome of perfectly fried chicken, with a crispy exterior that gives way to tender and succulent meat. The portion size is generous, ensuring that you get to savor every delectable morsel. If you're a fan of fried chicken, this is an absolute must-try that will leave you craving for more!"
Waker Chicken,"Ordered delivery. Food arrived nice and hot, LOVED the honey butter flavour  However, considering the price, the chicken parts given were too small. Also, if you're ordering the honey butter chicken, would suggest that you ask for the powder to be sprinkled on the chicken directly. If packed separately, the powder given is WAY too little and they're not willing to give more"
Waker Chicken,"The queue and waiting time was quite long on a weekday evening. You can expect to wait around 20-30 mins for your order, depending on the crowd. The chickens are freshly fried though, so they are served piping hot. The chicken parts are much smaller than the photos so a portion of 7 chicken would be just nice for 2 pax. The meat is juicy and tender and taste pretty good. Original and soy sauce would be safer bets. The honey butter can be a little sweet and taste like milk powder."
Waker Chicken,"It is true enough that I will be never disappointed with the Korean BBQ chicken. Bought 2 flavours fried chicken from this store to try. Both flavours are super nice, specially the honey butter fried chicken. Not sure what’s the powder that they put for topping but it’s sound like sour plum powder with butter. The combination is just super tasty and the chicken meat is crispy, juicy and soft. Will try other flavours next time. A bit pricey, though… however, I still want to recommend this store to all of you."
Waker Chicken,This is a 3-piece chicken meal. Very disappointing. It’s one piece with 2 small/half pieces! The worst is the 2 half pieces are mainly bones only! And the cost for take-away is $7.80. Not worth the price.  Flavours are okay. But I felt very disappointed with the portion and the price.
Waker Chicken,Waker Chicken serves up excellent Korean Fried Chicken without the need to wait 30 minutes at a typical Korean restaurant. The original crispy chicken is on par with the best Korean fried chicken you can find in Singapore. Was pleasantly surprised with their honey butter option. It’s great fried chicken with a twist. Superb. Can’t wait to try some of the other flavours on offer.
Waker Chicken,Pretty good value for Korean fried chicken at heartland and reasonable prices! Food came relatively quickly and the hawker center was not as crowded as expected on a Sunday night.
Waker Chicken,"satisfying our cravings for Korean Fried Chicken :South_Korea::poultry_leg::sparkles:  we tried the sweet spicy rendition ($14). coated with sweet spicy sauce, the crispy juicy chicken is not as spicy as I expected :fire: we ordered the half portion (7pc), which comes with a variety of wing, drumstick and other parts.  Overall, value for money and enough to satisfy our cravings :pleading_face: I’d be back to try their honey butter and soy sauce flavours!  :red_exclamation_mark:Some branches only accept cash. We visited the Holland Drive branch, which only accepts cash though we’ve seen reviews of other branches accepting other modes of payment :money-mouth_face:  :camera_with_flash: Instagram/Tiktok/Burpple: @myfoodframes"
Waker Chicken,"I really wanted to like this place, because wouldn't it be cool to have a nice korean friend chicken place in a hawker center?  But I also have to be honest with myself. The chicken was dry, even considering that some were breast meat; and the sauces are really not that good: ""sweet spicy"" tasted like ketchup, while the ""soy"" dressing was thin and watery. ""Honey butter"" was okay, but suffered from the dryness of the chicken (powdered seasoning on top of dry chicken.) The subpar sauces of course did not pair well with rice in the rice sets.  I guess if you've never eaten a fried chicken too dry for you, you could try this spot? Or maybe give it a shot for the novelty of korean fried chicken in a Singapore hawker? Personally, though, I don't think I'll be coming back for more."
Waker Chicken,"Very delicious! We came 12 sharp and was lucky the first customer. Subsequently, the customers keep coming in and crowds start to come.  Love the egg ramyeon, tofu soup and importantly, the star dish, Original Crispy fried chicken. Very tender, fresh and juicy. There's a special marination for the fried chicken as there's an appetising kind of fragrance and taste. We down the half chicken completely. We finished all the dishes. I slurped down my egg ramyeon entirely, including the soup. The Korean couple of the stall are friendly and lovely. Thank you for the cooking such a wonderful Korean food. Simply awesome."
Waker Chicken,6/12: Omg d original cripsy chic is so nice! It is tender and juicy inside with a crispy outer. I actually finished d 7 pcs by myself without even dipping to any sauce. The kimchi is not bad as well. I definitely will be back! The one who take order might b d owner and most likely a Korean from his English accent so do pardon him for not able to strike conversation. Most impt their fried chic is so Damm nice!  6/17: Came bk to try their crispy chic tender to goes with d sambal prawn fried rice. Tender is nice but their chic pcs are even better. Nevertheless goes very well with d sambal fried rice :face_with_peeking_eye:. The only problem is this coffeeshop has too many good stuff but very limited seats. The indoor seats are pretty warm while outdoor 1/3 tables occupied by season old uncles while 1/2 tables reserved by various stalls :confounded_face:  7/1: I know fried chic is not good for health BUT I can't resist this juicy and fresh fried chic that I can just finished half chic without even need any sauce to go along (but goes with beer)... this time i came at 8pm and have more seats and less Q ...  7/15: :face_with_peeking_eye: Ooops can't resists this fried chic that goes so well with beer :beer_mug:
Waker Chicken,"We went for dinner last night at about 7, and the kopitiam already packed with customers. Quite tough to get a table. This was the 2nd time with Jade's chicken. This time we order army stew and my all time favourite, fried chicken original crispy. The fried chicken still taste palatable.  Standards remain the best. Army stew soup was concentrated and tasty. It goes very well with rice. I also love the white radish, I always finish it. It really enhance your palate. The crisp, sourness and juicy goes very well with fried chicken so it doesn't feel too much. Really best korean food, but do go earlier because the later it is the longer the queue."
Waker Chicken,Good korean fried chicken. Had the crispy half chicken and the soy tenders. Was expecting the soy to be savoury but its more towards the sweet side like coffee pork ribs in those tze char.  Overall worth a try
Waker Chicken,"Will not return.  The chicken meat itself has no taste. Despite the copious amount of seasoning on the surface, the meat beneath is plain and flavourless.  I admit the batter is light and crispy, fried to perfection. But it seems that the chicken itself had not been seasoned at all. So although the surface has all these different styles and flavours, it isn't enough."
Waker Chicken,"This is a personal opinion. Indeed “awaken taste”, I was “meh” with the taste.. - This is a 3pcs rice set.. soy chicken @ $7.50 - Advise that you don’t try the rice set… the yellowish-Orange rice is NOT fragrant rice. - size of chicken pieces are so damn small (1/2 a palm sized) probably due to the pricing. - Only potato fries & coleslaw are good..  I will not try again. Thank you"
Waker Chicken,"Tried Waker Chicken (Bukit Batok) by ordering their original fried (half) and a box of French fries.  Loved the batter for the chicken and the crunchiness. Even though I ordered takeaway, it’s still very good when I reached home 10 minutes later.  Will definitely revisit this place!"
Waker Chicken,Ordered honey butter and soy flavour. The staff are very friendly and food were served promptly. The kids enjoyed very much.
Waker Chicken,The chicken wings were freshly prepared upon ordering. There were a selection of flavors to cater to all taste buds. Personally I like the original flavor.
Waker Chicken,"Taste wise I am satisfied, but quite disappointed with the size & portion of the chicken/food. It’s too small for a thigh and tender chicken been cut into smaller pieces. Waker means BIG but it’s the opposite."
Waker Chicken,"Ordered the Soy Sauce and Honey Butter chicken. Soy Sauce was ok, but the sauce doesn't coat the entire chicken generously like 4Fingers. The white powder seasoning for the Honey Butter chicken was used sparingly also, and more salty than sweet.  Perhaps the other outlets might be better. :thinking_face:"
Waker Chicken,Tried the Honey butter chicken rice set and and extra Soy chicken fillet al a carte. Both tasted really good and sweet.
Waker Chicken,Ordered for honey butter chicken. Instead received normal fried chicken. Price alot different.
Waker Chicken,"Attempted to order Sweet and spicy but no stock. Hence I ordered Soy sauce flavour. The chicken is not very crispy and nothing like the one I ate in Seoul. In fact, I made better than this. Final verdict is pedestrian."
Waker Chicken,Bought a number of times. Taste is good quantity is just right for the price. Honey butter is the all time favorite. Although 3rd n 4th buy the honey taste isn't present..n Its still crispy even after 50mins of travel update: the soy sauce is the current family favorite. less salty and less sweet than 4fingers. their chickens are all the same original flavor but will be tossed in the sauce u pick
Waker Chicken,Had this last night i chose the original fried chicken (spicy). It was crispy on the outside but the meat was very tender even for my elderly parents. Would definitely return! I want to try another flavor next time.
Waker Chicken,"The food is great! The flour and coating of the chicken is very light and airy! The cashier could've been a little more patient tho. Overall, great"
Waker Chicken,Could have been better flavoured but chicken is juicy. Def on the sweeter side.
Waker Chicken,"This is what original crispy chicken rice set $5.80 looks like. I would have given them 3.5 star if they provide bigger chicken at $7.50? Anyway, this will be my very first and last purchase."
Waker Chicken,"Affordable hawker price for Korean styled fried chicken.  You get to choose your preferred flavor.  I had and liked the butter honey so far, less so for the soy based variant which iad previously from the same stall."
Waker Chicken,"Picture looked really good and the menu item seems intriguing so decided to give it a shot.  The tender set (honey butter) I bought cost about $6.50. Quite sweet and not really to my taste buds but I guess that is honey butter for you. Texture of the chicken was great though.  Fries were a bit disappointing as it was bland, had to use condiments."
Waker Chicken,the portion of rice is quite small but the buttery taste is amazing chicken size is kind of expected since it’s korean chicken soy sauce tastes great!
Waker Chicken,One of the best fried chicken in Tampines neighborhood. I always eat the original fried chickens and never with sauce hence I can only comment on that. Chicken is juicy and crispy. Taste is just right too.
Waker Chicken,Order original chicken and honey butter chicken. Chicken was ok :thumbs_up:the Honey butter chicken should put more . Not enough.
Waker Chicken,"The ultimate test for crispy fried chicken is to buy take away and see if it is still crispy after some time.  I did exactly that to my 3 piece chicken rice set from Waker Chicken. Lo and behold, it was still crispy and tender when I ate it 30 mins after I received my order. The chicken seasoning was a tad salty for me but others would have liked it. The rice was buttery in taste which was delicious but the fries were a little soggy. For that I gave it one star less.  Sorry to compare with the famous K Fried Chicken but it’s nowhere near Waker and Waker has more to offer in terms of different flavours. No wonder it is opening outlets one after another."
Waker Chicken,"Waker chicken @ Clementi - Placed order for  1 Original chicken tenders x 8pcs & 1 spicy chicken (Full chicken) x 14pcs - both takeaway. Upon reaching home.. only to find out that my spicy chicken = 7pcs. As I'm not from Clementi (happened to be near there & decided to tp for dinner), I found it not worth to go all the way back to claim for the other 7pcs. Do note that i paid $38.80 cash. Btw.. why do you have to cut up the chicken tenders? So, pls check your orders carefully before leaving!"
Waker Chicken,"A new chain of fried chicken perhaps but personally I have not tried their fried chicken.  This is a stall located inside a newly opened coffee shop called Chang cheng. Anyway, they offer Korean style fried chicken in which one can choose the seasoning like spicy, sweet and spicy, soy sauce and butter honey. Quite an interesting menu and this is the first time that I see a Korean styled fried chicken at a coffee shop. A new option for the residents here."
Waker Chicken,"I am glad that the business is doing well and the food is great. However, I personally feel that the manpower could be better as I observed only 1 person is tending to all. This is my raised concern to the Human Resource or the higher management level to buck on their employment to mend the place with smooth and ease. When the well being of staff is cared for, the food and business will always be top."
Waker Chicken,This is my second time ordering and the stall assistant told me that the butter rice is sold out. Why is it always sold out when I just wanted to try the butter rice to pair with the chicken? I started queuing at 7pm and my order was only taken at 720pm. It was already 8pm when my food is ready. I ordered a take away of 3pc chicken meal and was given 1.5pc chicken instead. How unscrupulous is this meal worth? I paid $7.80 and all I received was 1.5pc chicken meal. The stall is understaffed and the management should look into the staffing issues. There are only 2 malay ladies working. A good workflow entails happier customers without the need to wait too long just to order and received their food.
Waker Chicken,"Been wanting to try Waker Chicken for awhile now as it was recommended by our friend, was not disappointed! :face_savoring_food: Ordered a 2 Piece Soy Chicken Rice Set and the Tender Soy Chicken Rice Set! Reasonably priced with the portions being quite huge! :face_screaming_in_fear: Chicken was tasty, rice was nice and buttery and the fries were really good! The Chicken Tenders were kinda dry when we ate it that day, but hopefully it was a one off! :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes: Waiting time however was the painful part, our order took awhile to prepare and we waited for around 25mins :loudly_crying_face: Nevertheless, we would definitely come back again to try their different chicken flavours :smiling_face:"
Waker Chicken,"Ordered the Soy Sauce chicken 7pcs $18.20 from Grab twice. Tastes great and is bigger than 4 Fingers. Today, I ordered the 3pcs butter chicken with rice and fries $7.90 at the stall. The butter chicken is nice but it can be too much for a meal because the white powder is quite salty. I would try the sweet and spicy chicken the next time."
Waker Chicken,"Ordered the tender set meal which came along with small pieces of chicken tender in ketchup sauce, coleslaw, butter rice and fries. The coleslaw was ok, the chicken tender were still quite crispy despite being drenched in sauce and would recommend eating the butter rice even though initially I was quite hesitant to eat this. Would probably go for their bigger piece of fried chicken next time."
Waker Chicken,"I was told that tender was sold out at 7pm on weekdays. Therefore, ordered original 2 piece set at $5.50.  It consist of butter rice, coleslaw, fries and chicken wings. Tbh, chicken is mediocre. It’s just the standard fried chicken wing. Size portion is quite small too. However, I enjoyed their fries. Thick cut and flavourful."
Waker Chicken,"Having had Waker Chicken at the Jurong outlet, I was so excited to find out that they opened an outlet in Yishun!  I love Waker Chicken, their chicken is always fried to perfection, crispy outside and crunchy inside. My go-to flavour is soy sauce, but I also tried the honey butter for the first time. It is good, but I'll stick to soy sauce. Will definitely be trying the sweet spicy soon. 100% recommended, you need to try!"
Chix Hot Chicken,"Yummy sloppy chicken burgers, expect a mess! Small corner shop, with some seating inside (air-conditioned) and outside. Nice hippy ambiance for hanging out with friends. The place filled up quite quickly when I was there, on a Saturday during lunch time! Convenient and quick meal. Weekday lunch times $9.90 meal deal (burger, fries, drink) seems like a good deal!"
Chix Hot Chicken,"Visited on a Monday afternoon. Great chill spot w lovely ambience. Food was not bad for the price paid. However, the waitress looked like she woke up from the wrong side of bed, her facial expression was darker than charcoal. Personally from a service industry myself, don’t think this is the kind of look a service staff should have."
Chix Hot Chicken,"Staff attitude were great, greeted to and kindly told us to wait for seats as it was full house. Expect a wait here as we visited past lunch around 3pm where it’s still crowded! Gonna give the atomic level of spice a review, would say even if you can take spice like me, this is definitely a killer to your senses. First half of the time when I was eating it felt fine but the spice hits you and drains you slowly especially at the end. Managed to finish the entire burger with the help of unlimited refill of drinks. Literally had quite a bad stomach pain throughout the day, good experience but never again at this spice level:face_with_tears_of_joy: tried the tenders as well, would say food is overall ok and prices are decent as well if you just get a normal meal."
Chix Hot Chicken,"nice ambience with good vibes, good for catching up with friends over a meal. recommended to go earlier to avoid the dinner rush, went at ~6pm and restaurant was pretty empty ◡̈ chicken was nicely fried, not dry. would recommend hotness levels above medium cause we tried the medium and actually not spicy at all :grinning_squinting_face::grinning_squinting_face:"
Chix Hot Chicken,"The staff there were very friendly! There is different level of spices. Recommend people to get the normal level for the spices Cuz it’s very spicy but yet very delicious. The chicken were so juicy! The place was quite aesthetic, good for your ootd. HALAL! Price range is affordable. This is Better than all McDonald meal :loudly_crying_face::loudly_crying_face:. The location is abit confusing as it’s like deeper inside but overall it’s easy to find. There’s toilet access. Hygiene is :hundred_points: very clean"
Victor Famous Fried Chicken Wing Rice,Came here to buy then realised its open at 11.30am. End up ordering porridge but waited too long till it’s open at about 11.10am. End up also takeaway Lemon chicken rice ($5) and added the chicken wings ($1.80 each now). :face_with_hand_over_mouth::grinning_face_with_sweat:  Hmmm. I found a hair in my food this time round.. nvm.  Overall it’s still Recommended! :check_mark_button:
Victor Famous Fried Chicken Wing Rice,"I missed the crispy specialty taste of Carona Fried Chicken, which was a well-known brand in the 1980s. The owner, Victor, sold the Carona franchise to a friend but continued to use the same recipe for his fried chicken.  The stall has been around for over 40 years and is known for its crispy and juicy fried chicken. The chicken is cooked to order and can be customized with various seasoning options.  The price is affordable, with options for both individual pieces or larger portions for sharing.  Highly recommended to try the chicken and pairing it with their special chili sauce."
Victor Famous Fried Chicken Wing Rice,"Happen to came to purchase some car spare parts. The coffeeshop is just right beside it. Once i saw the signage, I remember the carona chicken wing rice in those days. The chicken wing is crispy yet not oily. :face_savoring_food:"
Victor Famous Fried Chicken Wing Rice,Very nice and crispy chicken wings comes with rice! Eat the chicken wings while its still warm to get maximal taste! Price $4.5 for 2 chicken wings with rice. The chicken wings itself is $1.6 each. Taste original. Could be long queue during peak hour. The aunties was trying their best to serve customer as soon as possible. Cash payment or Paynow/scantopay accepted. Must try!
Victor Famous Fried Chicken Wing Rice,"Many described this stall as a lost and found from the Corona fried chicken of old. The current sell is it's Fried Chicken Wings. Usually spotting a long queue to rival the Hainanese Porridge and Mui Siong Minced Pork noodles. The fried wings are now $1.80 a piece, and a piece is never enough, thus go right ahead for $4.50 fried chicken wing rice which comprises two succulent freshly fried chicken wings and you get to try the fluffy Hainanese chicken rice. Sweet dark sauce and Chilli sauce on the counter for your self service. My take is to use the sauce sparingly, as the fluffy rice is flavourful on its own and doesn't really need the dark sauce. Also the chilli sauce, while pack good heat, is a tat watery and too vinegary for my taste. The fried chicken wings though we're superbly fried till a light crisp, lightly marinated with only the basic salt and pepper, in fact you can barely even taste the ginger, thus the fresh, juicy chook taste shines through. That's the beauty of the fried chicken wings here. Pair that with the flavourful, fluffy and succulent chicken rice, it's a match made in heaven."
Chic-A-Boo,"An alternative to the epitome fried chicken offered by KFC. Efficient operation, plus point on the nice hot fried chicken that does not give you the feeling of death chicken. Ie. Chicken is being left on the shelf for so long that you feel that it's pretty stale when it's served. The side dish that comes with it is remarkable. Excellent place to have a cheap decent meal."
Chic-A-Boo,"If you are hungry and like fried chicken, that's the place to go ! Big portions and simple taste. Many options for side dishes. Place is cleaned and have a nice family vibe. Good value for money. Highly recommend."
Chic-A-Boo,"In my opinion, the best fast-food fried chicken. They have two versions - original or spicy. My favorite is the spicy version - crispy, juicy with a bit of kick from the spicy marinade. They have fish too but if chicken is part of their name, why try anything else?"
Chic-A-Boo,"Both original & spicy chicken taste nice. Served hot. It comes with a set, u can choose your side dish. We came during weekday for lunch, there's plenty of seats."
Chic-A-Boo,":loudspeaker: #ChicABooReview: Just had the best chicken fry experience at Chic A Boo in City Square Mall, Singapore! :poultry_leg::sparkles: From the moment I walked in, I knew it was going to be a great first-time visit. Here's why you should check it out:  #DeliciousDelights: The 2-piece combo I ordered was a complete winner! The chicken fry was freshly cooked and had no visible excess oil. Every bite was bursting with flavor, leaving me wanting more. #CrispyAndTasty  #SatisfyingSides: The combo also came with 2 sides, and I chose the Cream of Chicken soup. Oh, my taste buds rejoiced! It was an absolute delight, creamy and flavorful in every spoonful. Definitely a must-try. #SoupLoversParadise  #CurlyFryCrush: The curly fries that accompanied the meal were a hit too! Crispy, golden, and perfectly seasoned. They added an extra touch of deliciousness to the whole experience. #FryPerfection  #FreshnessMatters: I couldn't help but notice the attention to detail in Chic A Boo's cooking. The chicken fry was incredibly fresh, and the absence of any excess oil made it even more enjoyable. You can taste the quality in every bite. #FreshAndFlavorful  #FriendlyVibes: The staff at Chic A Boo were warm, welcoming, and attentive. They made sure my visit was pleasant and ensured I had everything I needed. Kudos to their excellent customer service! #HospitalityMatters  Overall, my first experience at Chic A Boo was a memorable one. The delicious chicken fry, heavenly Cream of Chicken soup, and delightful curly fries left me completely satisfied. I highly recommend giving it a try, and I'm already looking forward to my next visit. #ChicABooLove #ChickenFryCravings"
Chic-A-Boo,Always love the spicy chicken here service is always pretty good as well but sometimes the chicken isn’t really tender like back then but the mozzarella sticks are always good other than that all is good! Would recommend if your craving for chicken though!
Chic-A-Boo,"Visited on a Friday night, place was crowded and very noisy. There was a large group of students and they were talking and laughing loudly which kind of affected our dining experience. Service was average - staff were not particularly friendly. Ordering is via self-queue (much like fast food). We’ve got the Hot and Spicy chicken set with different sides ($9.80 per set) and a pulled BBQ chicken nachos ($5.70) before GST. No service charge as it’s self service. Quality of food was average but it makes sense based on the pricing. Decent comfort food."
Chic-A-Boo,"We ordered the Cheesy burger , fried fish set ,pulled chicken salad and Japanese curry rice. All tasted ok except the curry rice which is miserably small ( like a kid's meal ) and not worth the price of $10.90. Definitely will order the Chicken but not the rest if we come again."
Chic-A-Boo,"First time visited this place, surprisingly the fried chicken is good! Had 2pcs Fried Chicken set meal with Hot and Spicy flavour and 2 side dishes of our choice, set comes with a drink. Fried chicken was tasty and the batter is nice. Crispy outside and still juicy inside. Got the thigh part and wing part. Side dishes were flavourful too. Overall it’s nice food and value for money. The restaurant is quite big and nice ambience. Service is standard. Will come back again :)"
Chic-A-Boo,"Another Lovely Fried Chicken in town (Singapore). This outlet located inside Marina Square, serves very crunchy fried chicken with various potato and side dishes to choice. Big Chicken and good price, love to try again next time if I am back to Singapore."
Chic-A-Boo,"First time at this outlet, and I need to say this. B---- is a superwoman :woman_superhero:, I'm so impressed with how she multitask the cashier, drinks bar, clears the tables, and manages the floor by herself. She even comes and greets diners and asks how's the food, etc. You guys are so lucky to have her in the team. The chicken is delicious :face_savoring_food:, and I enjoyed it while observing B---- manage everything. I'm so impressed that I need to come here and give her a 5 stars rating. Power la! :call_me_hand:"
Chic-A-Boo,"Ordered at 5.55pm, cashier did not inform me that waiting time was 30 minutes and I only heard after she told the customers after me. I was in a rush so luckily the food came promptly in exactly 30 minutes but they got my order wrong. I asked for 2 pieces of spicy chicken and they gave me 1 original 1 spicy and my sweet potato fries were cold. I didn't want to question the cashier as I was already late and was rushing, but meal was subpar, much better off going to fast food chains. Save your time and money."
Chic-A-Boo,"Very nice chicken. Tender and juicy. Nicely marinated. Bonus is even though choice of chicken parts is not possible, we didn’t get any breast without requesting. Curly fries is very good, hot and crispy. Same goes with pop corn chicken, a little bit spicy for kids but good for adults. The only thing we wouldn’t recommend is the mash potatoe. Even with the warm gravy, It was still a bit cold."
Chic-A-Boo,"Ordered the Set Meal 2 that came with 1 drink, 2 sides and 3pc chicken.  Got the hot one but wasnt really spicy. Skin was crispy and meat was still juicy and tender.  Didn't get choice of chicken parts.  Self service and tray return but no service charge so it's ok.  When crowded, there might be people standing in the queue to order close to you if you're eating at the tables in the middle of front of the counter which can get annoying."
Chic-A-Boo,Four stars for the senior lady at the counter who is full of energy and polite. I think her name is Betty as shown on receipt. Minus one star as the pulled chicken salad is very disappointing. Small portion of green with a few pulled chicken from a fried chicken. Very pathetic. Will come again to try their fried chicken.
Chic-A-Boo,"Eat this fried chicken from many outlet across Singapore, but this one still serve the best food. Not sure what different from others but the pieces cut in consistent every time and the flour batter is evenly spread on the chicken.  All the side dishes are good and fried to crispy when serve. It’s come back if I crave for this fried chicken."
Chic-A-Boo,"Chicken was a little bit pepperish. Seems a bit too much black pepper on it for my preference. The skin was crispy, didn't taste any spicy even though ordered spicy one. Overall ok only. Not that fantastic.  Usually have a lot of people on queue that I never order this but today was less queue and I tried the chicken at last."
Chic-A-Boo,"This place was quite busy around dinner time. Manage to visit before the crowd. It was quite sunny though around 4 to 5pm. We have to queue and the cashier will assign table for us after order over the counter. The fried chicken is quite nice, the sides can be chosen from various options. I took the onion rings and twisted fries but ended too much, should have gone with salad instead. This is a must try if you guys have not try it before to exercise your taste buds and find your preferences."
Chic-A-Boo,"Nice fried chicken with various choice of side dishes. Alot of seatings as well, just avoid peak hours as they conviniently opened till 10pm. The staffs were friendly and nice ambience with not so loud music as well. Overall, nice fast food experience."
Chic-A-Boo,"Good chilled out place in Sembawang Shopping Center. Got the $10.90 3 pcs set.2 pcs Spicy(crispy skin with a kick) and 1 Original(peppery taste). All 3 pieces were freshly made and was juicy and tender.Got the Coleslaw and Twistee fries which were nice as well.  The only downside was the wait for the food.It was exceptionally long for a fast food place,almost 20 mins!"
Chic-A-Boo,"Clean environment, good customer service. Slight delay in food. They made up for it by giving extra chicken for 2 piece chicken meal. Their sides are really fresh. For the BBQ Nacho's could be more saucy, totally not what it looked like in the menu. Otherwise it has good tasting chicken."
Chic-A-Boo,"Very small outlet of Chic-a-boo at #01-12 of Woods Square just beside Andes by Aston. I always love to come Chic-a-boo for the burger. Usually ordered either Mayo Chicken, Hot Chicken or Cheesy Chicken burger with a meal. And I will order cream of chicken soup for the side as I like the taste of the soup. What i love about the burger is that it is really big if you see from my picture (size of my hand) with a big piece of chicken thigh meat in the middle."
Chic-A-Boo,The chicken is really good. And the fish as well. The potions are huge. Really worth your money. Bring your kids along if you want them to have a good huge potion meal. The food quality is good as well. The plates are heavy. Seems to psychologically make u feel like u are dining in an expensive restaurant. The menu is not like fast food but a a little like steakhouse side dishes type. Try it. Its really worth it
Chic-A-Boo,Just placed an order for 4 pieces of chicken a-la-carte.  At $3.80/piece I requested for drumsticks and thighs.  Totally disappointed. They decided to give me 4 pieces of breast meat. Well done!  What's the point of paying $3.80/piece when you can't get what you're paying for.  Never buying from them again.
Chic-A-Boo,"The outlet is small with limited seats, but service is quite fast. Had the bbq burger and wings, it's so good. Burger is so juicy and portion is quite big too. Sweet potato fries were nice and crispy. Garlic bread is delicious too, staff said that's the best side item. Cheese fries were okay. Coleslaw was good, very flavourful. No regrets, must try!"
Chic-A-Boo,This a new favorite which serve  chicken and other fingers and sides. The 2 chicken meal original and spicy is tender and juicy better than other brands that we have tried. Mashed potatoes are soft and tasty. The winglets and drummets with sweet sour & garlic soya sauce  is delicious. We love the food and don't mind to come again
Chic-A-Boo,"The chicken was nice and juicy. Better than that of McD, Texas and KFC. The hot and spicy chicken, which was surprisingly quite spicy. (Even though I'm Korean! I love spicy :face_with_tongue:) But it's so nice that I will try again in the future. Curly fries reminds me of McDonald which is a good one.  Would definitely come back again. :thumbs_up:"
Chic-A-Boo,"First impression was that the store was clean and nicely decorated for a food establishment.  However, staff often is in the kitchen and not at the front desk. But perhaps that was because it was off-peak hours.  As with fried chicken, many would prefer the option to choose the parts they like to enjoy their meal. Unfortunately, Chic-a-boo doesnt allow that. Or at least that was the staff that told me. So i was given 1 drum, 1 wing and 1 rib for my 3 piece meal.  I chose both sides to be onion rings, but it came out slightly charred and bitter. Very disappointing i thought.  But a consolation was that the fried chickens are really juicy for their ""Favourite"" variation."
Chic-A-Boo,"No need queing, there is clean toilet inside. 2 chiken, 2 side and 1 drink $9.8."
Chic-A-Boo,"Initially, I and wife was excited to see Chickaboo opening at Changi Village. After, a few visits at this outlet we find that items after not replenished at such an early hour.....their reason is they are not able to prep too many items as business is not good. Just the other day, again everything is finish, and that was just before 8pm. His reason is no stock being delivered due to the bad weather.....pls this is Singapore not Malaysia. I believe every outlet should have their parr stock and how much they should prep daily. I love your food but find it very disappointing to always hear from your staff...we have only this??? I think someone in management should see and monitor why this is happening...staffs can be compleasant when there is no crowd."
4 Fingers,"Shrunken chicken! Price increased but chicken size is TINY I'm not even kidding!! Fries not hot or fresh, and I think they changed the recipe for the fries a while back (used to be nice and tasty but now just generic frozen fries). Tables are dirty everywhere as there doesn't seem to be a staff dedicated to cleaning. Only saving grace is that the lady at the counter is lovely and patient."
4 Fingers,i was really full after eating and if i need to eat again i will definitely consider coming here. early dinners are rlly cool but im so sleepy rn because i ate so much :sleepy_face:
4 Fingers,Staff there are so friendly especially hanisah. thank you so much for your service! :star::star::star::star::star:
4 Fingers,"Suspect the 5 star reviews here are most mostly fake. Drumsticks are pathetically small, with little or no sauce at all. Drumstick is not fully cooked too, can see the blood. Rice portion is little, kimchi is little too. Definitely not worth $9.50."
4 Fingers,"Horrible service,  short change my orders. Food is cold , chicken hard n col. Drink machine dispenser come out water instead soft drink. Will not patronise this outlet anymore."
4 Fingers,Two thumbs up for 4 fingers. Their fried wings was so delicious. So crispy outside and tender inside. The only problem was they gave tissue wipes to clean our hands. As Indonesian I really need sink to wash my hand :grinning_face_with_sweat:
4 Fingers,"Crispy, flavorful Korean fried chicken paired with hot, crispy fries make for a truly satisfying experience at this 5-star gem! No complaints here - a must-visit for all Korean fried chicken lovers."
4 Fingers,"First try, last try. Cold chicken and fries, wings are so bad that it felt as though I was biting into a shell. With each and every bite, the burning question at the back of mind was, ""how is this even food"". Took me so many years to finally give this brand a try, never looked appealing anyways, turned out to be spot on."
4 Fingers,The cashier (an old Chinese lady) is very helpful! Had lunch here. Chicken is well cooked and crunchy. The spicy sauce isn’t that spicy (considering that I cannot tolerate  spicy food that much). The fries seasoning is too little. But still a nice place to eat
4 Fingers,Have a pleasant dinner with my friend. The atmosphere is really welcoming. Staff hospitality is good as well. Good job for 4 Fingers Management Team in Orchard. Keep up a good work. We're looking forward to come here again someday
4 Fingers,"One of the best outlets for fried chicken. Fresh ingredient, cooked well and good seasoning. Would recommend people to come here. Clean environment and well maintained. Great staff and friendly too. Staff always try to keep the store neat and tidy. Very recommended. Will come again later."
4 Fingers,Burger was extremely salty with the sauce. Chicken meat was dry. It was not a very pleasing experience.  Not many seats around. Mostly outside. Only one low and one high tables with Aircon.  Staff was confusing when I tried to ask for more details. Think need better training and better quality control of food. But for now I won't be back at this branch anytime soon.
4 Fingers,"Do not ever buy from here. I ordered the 6 piece boneless chicken and all I got was fried chicken skin. No meat whatsoever in them. Looks disgusting, tastes disgusting. Would recommend going to another outlet, just don't buy from here. Thank god I ordered pickup from grab. Was able to get a refund."
4 Fingers,Food is amazing! Restaurant atmosphere was the best ; Service by the girl name Karen was excellent :thumbs_up_light_skin_tone: :partying_face:   Highly recommend to my family & friends.:star:
4 Fingers,"I enjoyed their current promotion of the Maki and Tenders! It was served quite fast and it is more interesting than the usual chicken and rice combo that I usually order. I really like the seasoning they put into the Tenders and the crispiness of the Maki! Their sauce tastes great with them, and served generously too!"
4 Fingers,"Maki was one of their best creation until they start giving you rice that is so sticky and glutinous that it’s disgusting to eat. Also , the chicken inside was sour ( I guess it turned bad already ) which make me suspect they probably use overnight or leftover corners of chicken for this dish they charge us for 5.90."
4 Fingers,The friend chicken were really good. I always love to visit 4 Fingers Stars of Kovan branch whenever I crave for it. The taste of spices and the tenderness of chicken always delighted me.The kimchi is pretty good too. Special thanks for all the lovely staffs who always serve me with their smiles. Great Job!!! I will definitely keep on coming back. All the best:)
4 Fingers,"I would like to send in my compliments to Star Of Kovan's outlet staff with the name of Jiahao, he has serve me with great customer service and he is very fast efficient with his speed of service. The food are served hot and taste delicious. Thumbs up to him and keep it up the excellent work!!"
4 Fingers,"This locations quality is trash. Waste of $50.  Boneless wings were just dry breading. Most of them had barely any chicken inside. Tasted and felt old, like they had been sitting out all day. Hardly any sauce.  The cheesy fries had 10% the cheese other locations give. Fries felt stale.  I love 4 fingers. This was my first time having from Stars of Kovan location.  Never ordering from this outlet again. Might not even order from 4 fingers after this, honestly. Most disappointing meal for all of us eating it."
4 Fingers,Rather disappointed at the food quality from this outlet compared to the others. Flavouring did not cover the entire chicken properly. Too much flour in some pieces. Fries were poorly coated too.
4 Fingers,"We enjoy 4Fingers every once in a while.  This Tuesday, my family told me that she wants to eat chicken wings at 4Fingers right now. I bought 18 pieces comb and we felt very happy at that moment."
4 Fingers,"4 fingers haha thats cute my first experience of 4 fingers its really sweet chicken if you expect crunch fried chicken like kfc, it cant be the good choice but somehow can be delicious snack. it was funny to try kimchi flavored fries as a korean:kissing_face_with_closed_eyes: burger was better than single ckicken wings. my brother really liked this burger and then he fall in love. Though we stayed in singapore for 2 nights, we visited 4 fingers twice beause of him:rolling_on_the_floor_laughing::rolling_on_the_floor_laughing::rolling_on_the_floor_laughing::rolling_on_the_floor_laughing:"
4 Fingers,Ordered seaweed fries but no seaweed the food was cold and soggy and the customer service was rude won't come back again!!
4 Fingers,A friend recommended this restaurant. Just ordered the normal chicken without combo 8.95 . I think it’s a little bit expensive. The flavor is good chicken skin is crispy and not too much flour this is the good side. So I think normally the crispy fried chicken is average standard. No need to come to try.
4 Fingers,"I ordered on foodpanda and it took 1hr to reach me, by then the food was soggy and wet cause of the heat and droplets were forming and my fries were disgusting. Contacted the driver and they said that 4 fingers gave him 3 orders at once?? Isn’t it supposed to be 1 driver for ONLY 1 order??"
4 Fingers,It’s very rare to see a 5.0 stars rating… went to see what’s the fuss about and we are hooked :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing: this is the second time we had over the span of 3 days ahhahaha so good!!!
4 Fingers,Friendly staff and fast doing work . Clean place and nice location.
4 Fingers,All are FAKE reviews.  You get 2 Wings free..If you post a 5 star review...  The chicken are a bit expensive. . And when you request for like 10 spicy and 10 non spicy.. They just dump all into 1 box...  Chicken are fried.. then just loosely painted with sauce.  So how does the children eat ?  Service wise.. the service crew are helpful and willing to explain the combos and stuffs...  But also you get is some wings and drumlets... Which are more expensive than Popeye or any other fried chicken stall...
4 Fingers,Very convenient n friendly staff offer great recommendation
4 Fingers,Nice and accommodating staff. Place not so much for dining in as there's only two small tables. Love the staff service best :smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes:
4 Fingers,Nicely packed done. Chicken is still hot and fresh. Thank you guys!
4 Fingers,"Have a total of 5 pick up orders. Given the number to the lady staff and only 4 items were given to me and nothing was conveyed to me. I thought the lady staff went to pick up the other item or probably the item is not ready yet. Waited for another 1 minute and a guy ask me what I'm waiting for. I told him I got a missing item, he get the item and just throw at the counter top and unhappily told me to pick up the item from his side and not from the lady side. Both the staff I met seems to have bad attitude."
4 Fingers,I have been your loyal customer. I already feedback this every time i order in GRAB but no action taken. Last night it happen again. I order 12 pcs of mix chicken wings and drumstick; you packed AGAIN 4pcs of wings and 8 pcs of drumstick. It is not like this before. It should have 6wings and 6 drumsticks evenly. If you only have all wings i already ordered ALL WINGS. Please dont do this alright because we pay accordingly. My cousin is a store manager in your company too if you continue this kind of practice  i will feedback this and will channel to your higher management.
4 Fingers,"Ordered the Wings Rice Box Combo via Grab and it came without the CHICKEN. Like how? Phone number linked to this outlet is also useless, uncontactable."
4 Fingers,Very good Korean fried chicken as you'll expect from 4fingers.. really glad that there's an outlet  just around the corner in the neighbourhood.. and also relieved that it's as good as hoped for considering a few less impressed ratings and comments before me. Just feel that they can do with some encouragement for the great stuff I got from them today.
4 Fingers,"If you love soy garlic chicken, you will surely love this. This is one of my go-to fast food. I love their chicken burger. It is huge ang juicy. It will surely fill your stomach. Their fries have flavors. But for me it is not tasty. I tried the seaweed fries. I can barely taste the seaweed. So you will go here for the chicken only!"
4 Fingers,"The staff - Zahma (if I didn't get it wrongly) is very kind and polite. He suggested what to have and very positive. It will be good to have more staff like him on the ground. If the management is looking at this, please give him some incentive. Date of visit 8 may 2023. Time of visit 6.51pm. Food can be slightly better as compared to previously."
4 Fingers,Having brunch today 14/6/23 and so nice that theres one staff (Zaman) recommended the new recipe cheesy cheesy chicken. And it was so good! Glad that i tried it :face_savoring_food:
4 Fingers,I was here many times but now I need to do a review for this outlet! I had a breakfast with friend and quite happy with the food and friendly staff.
4 Fingers,Ordered their 18 pieces boneless chicken bites via Foodpanda. The chicken is tender and crispy. The sauce has a hint of sweet and spicy which is perfectly drizzled to the chicken. Will order again.
4 Fingers,Small little outlet for delivery n take away... $19.20 for a buddies meals consist of burger / rice set with 2 drumsticks/ 2 cans of coke n a very small little packet of fries seem a little overpriced... fries should be bigger thou... :unamused_face:
4 Fingers,The chicken is flavorful but it is overpriced in my opinion
4 Fingers,food exceeded my expectations. the portions were generous. service? tip-top. + manager Khairul was kind & patient with assisting us on our order.
4 Fingers,"Horrible! Worst fried chicken ever. Ordered thru grab and was totally disappointed when I receievd the food. The chicken, fries and mozarrella sticks tasted stale, dry and burnt. I believe they have re-fried the food. Totally unacceptable for this standard of food to be sold to consumers. Waste of money."
4 Fingers,"This could have been a 5 stars, have not for serving me with COLD chicken wings and thigh.  Made an advance purchase via Foodpanda for later collection. When I arrived at my schedule timing, my orders are ready for self collection on the metal rack.  Shortly after I reached home and noticed only the Japanese rice are lukewarm while all the chicken pieces are COLD!  I am quite sure that they have already prepared my order irregardless of me indicating that my collection is for a later time, 35 minutes later.  So disappointed! And it's a joke that the box has a WARNING ""PIPING HOT"".  Edited: After I have submitted my review, I read other reviews confirming this outlet has been serving cold food to their customers! Changed my rating from 2:star: to 1:star: for being nonchalant."
4 Fingers,Takeaway only outlet. I ordered through the website for pickup and the order was ready for collection within 5 minutes. Very efficient! The staff was very friendly and asked if I wanted my drinks chilled as it was sitting out for a while when I collected it.
4 Fingers,"I enjoyed the food, but what makes my experience really memorable is how the staff take care of their customers, especially the Fat Manager Emman,  Thank you, sir, for the amazing experience. 10/5"
4 Fingers,"This is a pick up store and no seating provided. But you can order online and pick it up when you reach. The interior is air conditioned so you can wait inside. There’s a 7-11 next door, mamak store, cafes and fast food places nearby as well."
4 Fingers,"Very poor service. I ordered around 5.30pm for 6.30pm pick up. When I reached around 6.30pm, I don't expect it to be ready. I asked politely if my order was done, but the girl who was attending to customers couldn't care less. It was just a nonchalant ""not yet"".  I waited patiently as I knew it's dinner time.  I didn't see any front manager on duty, so to be fair, the girl's responsibility wasn't really in fronting customers. My order was finally ready around 6.45pm. I saw the girl prepared the order (without knowing it's mine), wrapped it up and stuck the online pick up order slip onto the bag, and left it on the table inside their area.  5 minutes passed before another staff asked me for my order number, to which he pointed to the bag as described as above.  The girl just left it there without informing customers the order number! Surely she knew my existence (and my number) as I asked her earlier on. And I was left standing and waiting like an idiot.  Very poor service."
4 Fingers,Friendly staff with great service provided. I love their mix drumsticks flavours bento set which comes with kimchi :drooling_face: Definitely the best combination ever :thumbs_up: Always my top pick whenever I visit any of their stores :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes:
4 Fingers,"Ordered the Signature Mix (Honey Mustard 2 Pax Bundle) for takeaway. The guy at the counter gave me 2 empty cups with cup cover and directs me to fill up my own drinks from the dispenser next to the counter.  There wasn't any queue and there's only one table occupied by dining customers.  The service was pretty fast and soon I got my orders in a carrier from a side food collection window. But wait, how about my drinks?  You expect me to hold 2 cups of soft drinks in one hand and use the other hand to hold the hot food ???  I have no time to argue as it was already 8:30pm and my kids are starving. So I used my tote bag to hold the 2 soft drinks. By the time I reached home. The tote bag was already soaked with soft drinks. Half cup plus half cup equals one cup.  Food wise is ok, according to my 2 teenage kids. Nothing special and portions is kind of small.  Seriously, there's room for improvement. Your counter person have to think from the customer's perspective. I ordered takeaway, not dine-in. You expect us to carry soft drinks in our hands all the way home?"
4 Fingers,Ordered chicken katsu salad and chicc crisps combo. The only disappointment is the fries. It doesn't taste kimchi and seaweed. It's just a little sprinkle of both flavours on the fries. It's as simple as just ordering a normal fries in any fast food restaurant.
4 Fingers,Ordered delivery on foodpanda. Delivered on time. Food was still hot and good.
4 Fingers,"The staff there was not friendly. Ordered online for dine in as nobody wanted to take our order. However, when our order appeared on the screen accompanied with audio for pick up, only a bag of food was there for collection at the pick up area. I waited for a few minutes to try to confirm with the staff however all ignored me and continued with their orders. I took it assuming it was mine and when I opened the bag to check, it was not what I ordered. I went back to returned it and was scolded by the staff hence they deserve this 1 star."
4 Fingers,Saturday evening is always a very busy day but SAM was fast & efficient serving the counter as a cashier as well as preparing the food orders. Kudos for a wonderful staff like her!
4 Fingers,"The chicken has too much sauce soaked in. The skin is way too sweet and dry while the meat has little taste. It's hard to eat more then a few bites. It's also mostly skin and fat, very little meat. They put a bun in the middle to make it look big even though you can't see it in the picture. Kimchi fries have no kimchi taste, it's just cajun power. It's cold, not crunchy nor soft. They try everything in their power to add $ to your order, asking your fries favor, if you want to upsize or add dissert in a low voice, listen carefully before you answer so you don't add random price increase to your order."
4 Fingers,"Had a craving for Korean Fried Chicken and 4 Fibgers seems to be the only option I had nearby. There was a short queue but it didn’t take long before I get a seat, the waiting time for the food is longer than expected, almost 30mins, probably it’s dinner time. Nonetheless, the fried chicken is tasty when serve hot, but the spicy sauce is not fully coated to the chicken. The fries is surprisingly good too. Best taste for dining."
4 Fingers,"Me and my sister decided to take a breakfast here. We ordered a wrap with a soft drink. We want to pay by cash. Then the cashier just key in the wrap x2 ($10)at first but request $15with us. My sis saw the total amount just show $10 but why she take $15 from us. She said is drink. Anw, she act like very busy but actually no customer there and try to skip to give us the drink receipt. At the end, I go to tell her , I need to keep the drink receipt then she just started to key in the drink and give me the receipt."
4 Fingers,Thanks alot Olive for the excellent service . She is very polite and friendly. She greeted us when we entered 4 fingers and also provided us with bb chair for my 2 years old boy. I will definitely come to causeway point 4 fingers again in future. :smiling_face::thumbs_up::thumbs_up::thumbs_up:
4 Fingers,"IF POSSIBLE,  NOT EVEN KEEN TO GIVE A SINGLE STAR! They don't deserve it at all. I ordered my food via grabfood. The whole meal price was $91.70 for 4 people meals. It was such an awful meal! The amount I paid and quality of food is disaster. Pathetic! I wish no one will ever do the same mistake as I did. NEVER EVER OREDER FROM 4 FINGERS FOR THEIR MEALS!!!!!!! ONLY THE CHICKEN SET IS VALUED FOR THE MONEY. PATHETIC FRIES, PATHETIC QUALITY OF RICE. COLD FOOD WAS DELIVERED!!!!! EVERYTHING WAS COLD. SALAD IS SUCH A PATHETIC MEAL. JUST SOME LETTUCE AND 3 PIECES OF CHICKEN WITH THE SAUCE AND IT COST ME $12.10!!!! DISSATISFACTION TO THE MAX. Worse experienced ever with food delivery."
4 Fingers,"ordered thru food panda. delivery was fast since it’s only 2km away from home  food was still warm when delivered. chicken seems fresh, however, it was not crunchy anymore. Fries was also a bit saggy.  i prefer spicy, soy was a bit too sweet for me."
4 Fingers,"2020: Ordered the 6-piece meal (half of both flavours) and added an additional drumstick. Everything was piping hot as it should be.  My parents visited this branch a few weeks back and they also said the food were hot and delicious.  One of the few branches that still serves HOT food. Keep up the good work! Will visit again. :)  Update: came here in 2022, chicken is cold, drumstick I ordered is dried up, fries seasoning is just a little sprinkle. Asked for chili sauce, the person in the kitchen only gave 2 packets lol. Have to keep going back again and again to ask for 1-2 packets of chili."
4 Fingers,Had the crispy chicken combo for lunch.Not the best experience. The bun was literally tearing & falling off when I held the burger. Sad. Meal did not come with chilli sachet.Guess need to ask at the counter.:thinking_face: Was going to order for take-away also but changed my mind.Staff was friendly. Spacious place.Can hold abt 40pax. Deco was inviting.Tables have a nice texture.Chairs are movable.Able to accommodate wheelchair diners.
4 Fingers,"Ended up here on a weekday night and was left without much choices for dinner, so went with this. I must really compliment the staff here for being on the ball even though it was half past 9, and still being welcoming despite nearing closing. The uncle at the lobby was very attentive, ensuring every inch of the table is wiped down before seating others. Food were served piping hot nearing closing hour too, which was comforting."
4 Fingers,Served one of the best chicken wings. Meat is fresh and tender. Prepared with their own sauce.  The Calamari and Shrimps is also a must try. Goes well with my red wine.  Overall experience is good. Uncle from lobby is attentive and polite. The cashier is also patient and done a good job to explain and advise what is the best option.  But I must say the taste does not fit everyone if you do not enjoy chilli hot stuff.
4 Fingers,"Had some miscommunication with the staff.  Thankfully he came out to clarify before passing us our order.  We tried the Monster, which was a little too salty for us. The seaweed fries were pretty average and bland.  I feel like you’re probably get better standards from other outlets."
4 Fingers,"i like the idea that it is just a pickup concept. however, i’ve got to say the standard of their food are pretty inconsistent :"
4 Fingers,"I’ve always got good impression of 4Fingers but the branch at Teck Whye gave me 2nd thoughts about going back. The branch there was for takeaways only so yes, you can be sure that you’ll get your orders promptly if you go for online and self-collection. However, the primary focus - food and it’s taste and portion failed. Good that they now have fish in their menu, but they didn’t manage to champ it. The fish were fried in thick batter, it was dry and we can’t get any bite of it’s meat at all. Yes, that dry. The chicken which was suppose to be their main sellout were also dry and it all tasted frozen. That’s not the end. Their fries was pathetically little. KFC do much much better."
4 Fingers,"Ordered on Foodpanda as a pick-up order, fast and fuss free (10min waiting time). The chicken is crispy and fried well. Overall I would say the taste is marginally better than KFC and definitely worth a try, as someone who’s almost never eaten Korean style fried chicken before."
4 Fingers,Like to take away from. this place and service was excellent. Food recommended
4 Fingers,"This fast food restaurant is small, only few tables and chairs but usually there are not much people dine in. Friendly staff and quiet environment."
4 Fingers,"Ordered as attached photo. Stated on receipt x1 6 Pcs Wingettes & Drumettes Combo & x1 chicken chop rice box. However, only received drumettes combo set and chicken chop combo set with fries, NO RICE. Evidence taken. Returned to the stall and asked for rice as the staff judging I didn’t bring the exact boxes I received just now. Judging that I no evidence showed, photo showed to him but he sounds not happy with my feedback. :slightly_smiling_face:"
4 Fingers,Small space in nee soon east community Nice variety of food Staff is quite ok and nice :thumbs_up:
4 Fingers,The portion size for the chickens are very small and the people preparing the items are so stingy that they don’t use sauce at all. Just fried chicken and the essence of the taste:face_with_tears_of_joy:. The area manager should take a look at this outlet’s food quality.  I had the same issues multiple times and I don’t find this issue in their other outlets.
4 Fingers,This outlet is stupid at packing takeaway or what? Piling the heavy water bottles on top of paper packaging which crushes the box and makes the food smooshed all over on the inside. Thumbs down!
4 Fingers,"The service to service food is fast and the place has many seats.  I order hot wings and shrimps, but they put sweet soy over the food... Icant even taste the spiceness on it.  For the flavor theres many wings have better taste...  I hate to say this but i dont recommend this resto."
4 Fingers,Chicken have become really skinny. Meat is super hard and dry. Fries are definitely overnight fries as they tasted stale. What an utter waste of my $35!
4 Fingers,"I just ordered this afternoon 12 pcs w&d. They didnt answer when i ask to pick my order, they wrongly packed the food. 2 guys in the kitchen always chit chat  not focus to work. When i ask they dont answer. I paid 16 SGD for real junk food. If I am the business owner, with so many bad reviews here I will fired those 2 guys."
4 Fingers,"Seems nice enough. Could use some pest control, urgently. Lots of little flies flying about, makes the hygiene very questionable."
4 Fingers,"Not worth the money. Hear so much about this place but disappointed by the lack of quality and flavor. Fries were cold, drinks station had No Ice. Staff are unfriendly. Should have ordered subway :see-no-evil_monkey:"
4 Fingers,Worse bun ever :pensive_face:. The description indicated soft bun but it tooooo hard. The ala carte photo shown includes fries but actually NOt
4 Fingers,"Ordered thru Grabfood. 16 piece winglets are nicely fried and seasoned with their signature spices. However, was thoroughly disappointed with the Loaded Cheese fries and 6 piece Boneless chicken combo. The amount of cheese is abysmally depressing, the fries are soggy and unsalted, the “load” is just overfried chicken batter, the boneless chicken pieces do not have much meat but are 80% batter and smaller than a finger lol. The only thing worth ordering are winglets"
4 Fingers,"Was at 4fingers Jurong Point today at about  11.45am.  It was quite crowded but nevertheless the greetings from the service crews was superb.  As usual, I ordered my family's favourites. We had a wonderful day to start with at 4 fingers today. The chickens and burgers were specially nice.  Will come back soon. Thank you to all 4fingers Jurong Point's staff for such wonderful service and food."
4 Fingers,"Ordered before 7.30pm via mobile order. Waited around 30min. Was disappointed that non of the food is warm. Food is still nice n tasty. Just, not warm/hot. (wondering wat are the wait for... :thinking_face:)  Burger taste awesome Fries is normal Rice is mushy, not the type i like. Chicken is juicy and crispy Chili lime flavours is interesting Soya flavours a bit salty, not to my liking Drinks are standard.  I think seafood sold out? Cant order via mobile.. Will try their seafood next time.  Looking forward to a warmer meal."
4 Fingers,"Ordered 2 Megasaurus Meal from food panda. Missing one fries and one coke. I mean, this is just a simple straightforward order. Totally ridiculous. The plastic bag was tied very tightly. It cannot be the rider removing it. Just plain incompetency and ruining someone's lunch. Unacceptable for a big company like this."
4 Fingers,"2 Dollars off our meal plus 6 free non spicy wings for a review of this. I’m typing this with a smile coz what they offered to us for $19.30(after 2 dollars off) was marvellous, magnificent and splendid. I label this mall as an outcast to be honest. I mean people visits this mall with the only goal of watching the latest blockbuster/exciting movie (in my opinion) but I was impressed with what I’ve tasted. A monster topper burger (jaw breaking special burger) that it’s fried chicken patty tasted so delicious, tender and crunchy that is coated with satisfying sauce and other ingredients which is the icing on the cake for this burger. The fries with kimchi and seaweed flavouring was wonderful. Served hot and yummy with it. The Kimchi spicy fried chicken was spectacular. Tender,crunchy skin coating the flawlessly fried and juicy chicken meat- yum yum. Would I come here again? Absolutely ESP before a movie :thumbs_up::fire:"
4 Fingers,"My regular go-to for chicken fixes!! So convenient, order online and pick up from store. This store is tucked away under escalator so when u drive pass the mall may not see it.  Didn't know there's done in quite spacious. Staff Hariiz very friendly :thumbs_up::thumbs_up::thumbs_up:"
4 Fingers,Quick breakfast with coffee for something below $4. Well pretty decent price but not filling :grinning_face_with_big_eyes: Would be nice to have the cheese melted though.
4 Fingers,This outlet is the best in the west in terms of the seasoning of the wings! Love it!
4 Fingers,"Clean place, friendly crew and fast service."
4 Fingers,"Came to this outlet to use a ” $2 voucher off 4 finger crispy chicken”. Staff said that the voucher is not valid at the outlet, despite not being expired. We came during an ordinary friday 2pm, printed as an allowed timing to redeem it. [Attached is the photo of the single voucher we were to redeem] No where on the voucher’s T&Cs said it could not be used. Also the restaurant is not cheap >$10 per pax and we get only a few nuggets and mini single segment wings. What a price for a snack. Not the first time we had such poor experience at 4 fingers. Sad that even after recent renovation and given a second chance, 4 fingers T3 Changi Airport still could not redeem itself as a restaurant worth visiting."
4 Fingers,"Food tastes good. The only setback is that the staff are not well trained. Twice I went there lately and twice the staff struggled for not knowing of how to proceed with Changi Pay. With the lack of knowledge, it had created a long queue. When the Supervisor/Manager came out, she wasn't happy in the first place to be called out to the cashier by her staff and she explained with a rude tone saying that the staff is new. So she helped me with the Changi Pay which was super fast. She slammed things at the cashier area and her face was not happy! Well, it's not my fault for your staff that was not being trained accordingly. Second, she should control her mood while working in Changi Airport best known for it's ""Customer Service"". We have to learn of how to control our emotions, mood and smile to make things better with pleasant words."
4 Fingers,"Great place for delicious fried chicken. The restaurant is quite big, so you shouldn't have a problem getting a table. It is a place that is suitable for a group of six. Be prepared to get your hands dirty, but you will be glad that they provide you with a packet of wet tissues. There's a public restroom nearby so it is perfect for washing your hands after you are done with your meal. Accepts all major payment methods"
4 Fingers,Cashier don't greet customer. Not happy to serve!!  Expensive chicken wings! Only given two wings with Four drummettes!! 6 pcs wingnettes ala carte!!
4 Fingers,Very bad service and unfriendly server who took my order. it's not busy at all yet no smile and so unwilling to advise me on the menu.  The fried chicken was too salty n not tasty at all
4 Fingers,For my order I already paid for Mozarella Cheese Stick is never included in my delivery order & food is too cold.
4 Fingers,Only for take-outs and deliveries. OK service. My 12-piece was ready in about 10mins.
4 Fingers,"Love it! The chicken is always really crispy, and the soy garlic sauce was good. Thank you for the friendly service too!"
4 Fingers,"I frequently order  your food but 4 finger Sembawang branch was so disappointed, food is always cold especially burger, and chicken , serve old meat ,But other branch is okay. 4 finger is one of my favourite but sembawang branch so disappointed, hopefully it will improved next time."
4 Fingers,Not a fan of fried chicken but really love love the honey mustard fried chicken. Fried chicken is crispy and tender. Hope this honey mustard flavor will stay on the menu:drooling_face:
Wings Stop,"Food is expectedly delicious as last time. Lemon pepper remains my favourite and the mushrooms is a must to try in here. This is a self-service place where need to clean up after having ur meals, but some are still leaving their leftovers on the table, which is very irresponsible. No one cleaning up the table and we have to clean to get a seat."
Wings Stop,"Ran out of green tea, Kecap manis chicken was good but the bbq one seems to just be dredged in bbq sauce from the bottle. Decent but definitely on the salty end as expected (fast food)"
Wings Stop,The slowest ever service I have ever experienced this year. Took almost 45 minutes for some chicken. Unbelievable. They were just taking their own time. No sense of urgency. Management has to take a look at this.
Wings Stop,"It was so good we went back again! Garlic Parmesan is the best. Ranch was fantastic. Louisiana run was alright, tasted like Cajun spices. It was quite oily at the bottom of the plate. Regular Fries was towards a thicker cut and I like that they left the skin on and was lightly seasoned with herbs, salt and sugar i believe. They give wet wipes if you dine in!"
Wings Stop,"Fav flavor: Kecap Manis and Garlic Parmesan, chef's kiss! :pinched_fingers: uncle Kelvin/Kevin that served us on the counter is so nice! And the serving time is pretty okay :))"
Wings Stop,"The food is always good, but the service is always slow. I also don't know why their chicken tenders are only available in certain locations when ordering online. PLEASE GIVE US THE 6PC/8PC OPTIONS FOR TENDERS BECAUSE 4PC IS TOO LITTLE.  My partner ordered the 6pc chicken wings and was shocked at how small the wings were. She is visiting from the US so it was definitely appalling for her."
Wings Stop,"ATTN: Customer Service Team  I ordered the 8pc Combo meal from your Bedok Mall outlet today for takeaway. I was called my recipt number and given the wrong item, which I only realised when I got home.  We contacted the outlet we bought from, Bedok Mall and both members of staff who spoke, (Wang and someone who claimed to be the Manager, also Wong or Wang were HIGHLY uncooperative & was not at all customer oriented. Not only did they hang up on us, but did not give us a proper solution to our issues, expecting us to have to deal with their mistakes. It was quite frustrating talking to them as they expected us to call the headoffice and sort their mistake. They could do with some customer service training.  This is very unacceptable and has damaged the reputation of the chain and my previous good experiences with the chain going with friends, colleagues and loved ones. Its a shame because I really like your food and the company, but its a shame that when your staff mess up, the customer has to suffer.  Its a shame it has to come to this but what has happened has happened and I expect something to be done about the very poor customer service at your outlet, and for something to be done to reimburse me for this mistake"
Wings Stop,"Ordered on a Friday night via Foodpanda for self pick-up. Did not have to wait for too long, however, order is not accurate. Order 6 classic wings with 3 x Pepper Lemon and 3 x Louisiana Rub but end up getting all Pepper Lemon upon opening them up at home, which is not a big deal. However, taste quality certainly has dropped. It used to be well marinated for all the wings and the peppery taste was spicy and savory, but now is just very salty and the lemon taste barely there. I hope is just some accidental batch since it is on a busy night."
Wings Stop,"I avoid this outlet as much as I can. The worst customer service possible. Today I went to pick up my food (I had ordered it around 40 mins before pickup and preparation time was 20 mins). When I went there the cashier lady said my food is not ready in the most condescending tone possible. After waiting a while near the counter, i just went to check the area for pickup and my order has been there. Please train your staff well and how to communicate. Also kindly don't misguide your customers and waste their time (it would have been easier to just say let me check). Horrible service and this was not the first time they have been rude and condescending. Avoid this outlet."
Wings Stop,No. 1 place to have the best chicken wings in Singapore according to me.. Their ranch is very unique and very yummy
Wings Stop,"The boneless chicken wing was definitely not fried on the spot unlike what they guarantee, it wasn’t hot and tasted like it had rested for quite long outside :(, but the fries were fried on the spot - crispy and hot. Not a fan of most of their flavours except for Louisiana rub! Also love their ranch dip!!"
Wings Stop,"Very nice boneless chicken wings with a huge variety of flavors. Liked the teriyaki and mango habanero ones in particular. Didn't like the texas buffalo tenders though, luckily the ranch sauce helped alleviate the IMO, not so nice sour flavor. Fries were great, the curly fries are reminiscent of McD's and the voodoo fries seems to be just the normal cajun fries + cheese and ranch sauce. Overall, nice food and great service"
Wings Stop,"In love with the ""Wings"". Loved everything except the  Garlic parmesan one. Best ones are ""Hickory Smoked BBQ""(Smokey and sweet), ""Teriyaki""(Sweet and Soy) , ""Lousiana Rub"" (Not too spicy) and the ""Kecap Manis"" (My personal Fav) AND their Woo-doo fries are exceptional(normal and ring fries are also tasty). They have some amazing offers too( had last month) hence pocket friendly !"
Wings Stop,"What is there not to love? Boneless chicken wings and simply amazing sides. Get the upgrades to the sides, the regular fries are decent, but the real star are the upgraded sides, putting even their wings to shame. Be it cheese fries, onion rings or fried shrooms, they have simply nailed it.  Their range of flavours for their wings simply give me an excuse to keep visiting them!"
Wings Stop,"The food was as delicious as ever, but the seating arrangement here is dreadfull All this store needs is some better seats and it will be perfect Worth going here I guess if you get the sofa, not really sofa seats (like the long wooden seats which can sit 3)"
Wings Stop,"Delicious chicken and great customer service, the table spilled my drink and they gave me a new one for free, the chicken has great seasoning and tastes really good. The have a ton of variety as well. The place is always clean and my order arrives quickly and the prices here are good value, I come here weekly, highly recommended to try!"
Wings Stop,"I’ve been here multiple times, and each time has been very enjoyable. The food is always warm and seasoned to perfection, and the atmosphere is very chill and relaxing.  I will definitely keep coming back for more!"
Wings Stop,"Ordered the garlic parmesan and buffalo wings viable Grabfood and felt they were below average. The sides - mushroom fritters and voodoo fries - were good though. Overall, I felt everything was a bit overpriced."
Wings Stop,An order take 45mins during dinner time. Kitchen staff is extremely inefficient. Kitchen manager is extremely nasty towards customer but is nice and cheerily chit chatting away with the younger part timers. Management should look into streamlining the process.
Wings Stop,Disappointed by the food. Quality is alright but this is not acceptable. Carrying my food home only to realize this is how little food I'm given for a $3 surcharge.
Wings Stop,We ordered from Grab food. We didn't expect that the crispiness and tenderness of the chicken were still intact!!! Thank you Wingstop for all your effort and working so hard to serve us delicious flavoured chicken wings. I personally love Parmesan flavour but my friends enjoyed the BBQ sweet and Spicy and Texas buffalo!! PLus make sure to have your sides Voodoo and mushrooms!!!
Wings Stop,Ordered for dinner during a rainy night. Food came after sometime but tastes freshly fried and was still quite warm. Recommend the fried mushrooms and kicap manis flavour
Wings Stop,im a delivery rider and i waited for almost an hour just to find out they havent key in my order. slow service seriously! do better
Wings Stop,The best American style fried chicken u ever had
Wings Stop,"The place was not easy to find. There was also no phone number to contact. Go via access 1 of the Nordcom 2 building. Go straight pass the gantry until you see agape laundry. For those driving or riding, you can park your vehicle anywhere around that area. Take lift number GLT2 to level 3 (follow the signs directing food delivery riders). At level 3 turn left into the building and walk straight pass the kitchens (do not enter the kitchens, keep left) until you find a window. Tell the staff your order shop and number. Food was good nonetheless."
Wings Stop,"When you think of wingstop in the past, it’s always made to order. Hot & crispy. Hence longer waiting time is very understandable. But this outlet is brings dining in experience to the next level.  Waiting 20min for dine in is apparently quite fast already comparing to other poor ratings reviews here. But yes, we waited 20min+ for 8 pc wing set meal. Chicken is not only small, but COLD! Insane how it takes them 20min to serve this out. Kitchen is constantly taking in delivery orders. Again doesn’t justify the poor quality food. Not cheap either.  Can patronise them if you wanna waste your time and money"
Wings Stop,"ordered pickup 10min at around 430pm, only got my order at 515pm. there was 7 staff & they were all taking their own sweet time preparing their orders. even people who ordered after us got their food first. when i asked about my order, they gave me vague answers & did not even get back to me after checking. ordered a few times from this outlet & it has always been very slow with even less customers. oh and they didnt even pack their food properly, there was spillage."
Wings Stop,"Went here to have a quick late lunch. 6pc classic wings with teriyaki & kicap manis with normal fries, whereas another was 6pc classic wings with garlic parmesan & texas buffalo with curly fries with cheese dip. Good portion. But seating area here was limited."
Wings Stop,"Worst wingstop at tampines hub. Ordered a 6 pieces chicken and waited for 45min. Nicely asked the cashier if they received my order, she said yes and I asked how long more. She just shoved me and said that sorry, alot of orders. The two different type of chickens can't even tell the taste differences. It's so apparent that they rushed through their orders. Will not recommend them at all!"
Wings Stop,"Horrible service. The cashier shooed me away when I was standing 3 steps away from the cashier counter. Best is, there wasn't any customers nor I was obstructing anyone. Waited for my order n realised it was prepared prior being shooed n was sitting at the preparation counter. No one bring it to the next process ie collection of food. The same cashier refused to acknowledge their blunter n her rudeness. Gave me my food with the std cold thank you. Wingstop took effort to conduct survey online but are you away of the service standard at your stores? Disappointed."
Wings Stop,@East Point mall. Food was great. But there were too many flies. I had to use a piece of tissue to cover my can drink because they kept landing on it. I was also afraid the flies will fly into my mouth. Minus off 3 stars for hygiene and flies. Plus I'm now having a bit of stomach ache.
Wings Stop,"It’s our first time having Louisiana Rub and we love it! It’s crispy and light, good for those who prefer wings without sauce. Kecap manis is a surprise I don’t remember it comes with a heap of fried onion, quite yummy but slightly spicy."
Wings Stop,"Not a great meal. Service was great but the chicken served was under seasoned, stale and borderline disgusting. Not to mentioned the reused oil taste that’s very apparent in the tough chicken.  Quinoa rice was soggy and mushy.  The sauces were extremely flavorless. Garlic Parmesan tastes bland."
Wings Stop,"feels like the staff there tend to focus on delivery orders more than dine in and takeaway. there was a couple waiting for their food (for dine in), before i arrived, and they were just waiting so patiently. then i saw this malay lady packing and leaving several delivery orders on the counter, one after the other. i was there for about 15 minutes and they had only gotten their food at the last second before i left. maybe it wasn’t how it looked, maybe the delivery orders came in before the couple ordered but they look like they had been waiting for awhile. anyways, for my experience, don’t bother to go up to the counter to order they will just tell you “scan the qr code to order” then walk away from you. i’m in the hospitality industry and thats definitely not how you speak to customers."
Wings Stop,"Wings were not too bad, I would rate them 8/10. Beautifully fried and seasoned well, it also came out decently fast. Ordered the $2 top up but couldn’t finish due to feeling too oily and jelak. This shop is located at the basement of EastPoint shopping mall."
Wings Stop,"Garlic parmesan goes extremely well with the ranch dressing. Lemon pepper had a distinct lemon taste with bits of saltiness coated externally. Mushroom fritter was not too bad, they use white button mushrooms and also goes well with ranch sauce."
Wings Stop,"No.1 Saltiest chicken ever tasted in Singapore! If you tried before herbal salted baked chicken and you think is not salty enough, then this is the most salty saltiest chicken ever! saltier than the salted bake chicken!! Saltier than my life! After eating this i decided to go to jb to eat the real salted baked chicken. Wing stop, their salt is free. Make your mouth thirsty for more water! WOW! the small can of water given by the set, is not even enough to quench my thirst!"
Wings Stop,"I had an unpleasant experience at wisteria mall branch. I wanted to pay with cash but the employee asked me to change to contactless payment because it's ""easier"". After I insisted on using cash, he struggled to give back my change because the cash register didn't have 5cent. It's kind of ironic that the price of most of the items on the menu end with 5 cents, yet the cash register had no 5 cents? Also he kept removing his hat and scratching his head which was unhygienic"
Wings Stop,"i went there in the middle of june, dont know where dont ask me. i can hear the staff behind clapping so random, so loud and long. shouting almost as if they were wrestling. got fight club ah there? in the end, my chicken tasted so salty and it tasted like swimming pool water. dont ask me how i know ONE STAR!"
Wings Stop,"The Cajun fries were not too bad, though not a fan of raunch sauce. The seasoned fries were ok. Had 4 different flavours of chicken wings. Lemon pepper had the best taste, while the teriyaki and BBQ were ok. I couldn’t really taste much of the garlic Parmesan. On the price point, it was still ok."
Wings Stop,"Been ordering here every week for the past few months. The food is always really good, albeit the cost."
Wings Stop,No wingstop restaurant here. It is just a kitchen to pick up online orders
Wings Stop,"Lousy kitchen, dont know fry what wing always take almost an hour, no oil no fryer pls close shop"
Wings Stop,the waiting time is horendous. hope they close down and make way for restaurant with better service.
Wings Stop,The absolute worst central kitchen. You can expect to wait beyond an hour! This place should be shut down!
Wings Stop,Always popular. Offers a variety of fried chicken flavour. Service tends to be very slow and waiting time for food to be prepared can take quite a long while.
Wings Stop,Underwhelming chicken parts. I feel terrible tbh that those chicken wings sizes are just way too small to be eaten. Sorry but never going back again.
Wings Stop,My second time trying and I really love the flavours that they offer. Inferno is really good though quite spicy!
Wings Stop,"Super tasty as a snack! We went for Louisiana Rub Wingless Chicken flavour , it came warm and the fries (voodoo) with cheese sauce is so good!! Highly recommend for a quick fried chicken crave fix!"
Wings Stop,"Excellent service from the staff in this outlet especially the bespectacled young staff. Food is great, love the ranch sauce."
Wings Stop,"The place is very comfortable, clean and welcoming. Staffs are nice and wait time is just right for piping hot, awesome tasting chicken. the fries is really well season and tasty, 100% recommend. Tried all the flavours except for texas buffalo so far and really loved all of them. Me and my girlfriend enjoy wingstop alot esp at the convenience of our humble abode, 10 10s highly recommended."
Wings Stop,"Cozy atmosphere, air conditioning was great. Food was bussin, the fries and onion rings were fried to perfection!"
Wings Stop,Pardon me not really a die hard fan of fried chicken. My first wingstop after passing many branches. I give it a try as it's a new establishment. Chicken I felt too dry. Quite a lot of favour to choose from . Love their custom soda machine to choose what type of drinks you like. Only thing I felt great is their fried mushrooms. Juicy mushroom coated with crispy batter. Nice little fast food joint hidden in a corner. Unfortunately I'm just not fancy about it.
Wings Stop,"The chicken with Louisiana Rub flavour is so salty, same for fries. The chicken with Teriyaki flavour has too much sauce in it. This is my first time and the experience is not that good. The meals for 2 comes with 3 regular sides, the sides that needed to choose from didn't state what items are needed to do a top up and some do not come with regular size based on the list."
Wings Stop,"Cosy outlet with cold air con. Service speed is ok, food is prepared fresh. Visited this outlet a few times and find it nice. Will return again."
Jinjja Chicken,Our favourite spot for delicious Korean wings! Jjamppong creamy (spicy seafood noodle) is a must order for those who like noodle in rich seafood soup! Always happy to see Bernard there to serve the customers with his friendly and warm smiles :)
Jinjja Chicken,"Got the tofu kimchi salad and it has a unique flavor. Not much of a Korean cuisine but a lighter meal as compared to the rest of the menu. Serving time is okay, not too long despite the fries. Have options for the drinks and I love the yuzu drink. Very refreshing."
Jinjja Chicken,This was a delivery order. I had the tofu bibimsalad and it was so good! Lots of fresh salad and very tasty tofu. The pepper dressing was very interesting as well. I would like to see glass noodle and more vegetable and protein add ons to make it a fuller meal. A different option from the usual salad bar.
Jinjja Chicken,"This fast food spot offers a convenient option for those craving Korean food. The taste of the jjajangmyun is decent and the noodles are soft and chewy. While the fried chicken with soya sauce wasn't very fresh and came off as hard and tough, it's understandable given that it's a fast food chain. The chicken was also quite salty. Overall, it's a decent, affordable spot to satisfy your Korean food cravings in the area."
Jinjja Chicken,Cashier is detailed when repeating order n food pickup is ok. But chicken is not hot (warm hot) as expected but overall experience is good for a fast food concept
Jinjja Chicken,"Had dinner here on a sunday evening. It was quiet at first but then after we ordered it got quite busy. But the staffs were calm and collected. Big thanks to AISHAH, ROY & SALLY! You guys are great and we shall see you soon! Keep up the good work and thank you!"
Jinjja Chicken,"The staff was great. They were patient when they explain the dishes  &  recommendation. Though the dine in area was small, it was good enough for ever moving customers. The staff serving me today were Yusra, Andrew and Roy they know their products well. The food were well prepared and the place was well managed. I ordered Rabokki dine in and later take away Jinja chicken for my family."
Jinjja Chicken,Great service from Aisyah and Misnah. They make my first time experience in Jinjja an unforgettable one with their passion for great customer service. Great choices of food for me to try and they even assured to secure me a table to dine in. Thank you so much!
Jinjja Chicken,We ordered the K-pop chicken with soy garlic and it was nice. The Tteokbokki fries could have been better by adding more tteokbokki and fries had over burnt . The Kimchi rice was very dry and not flavourful and they could have an option to add meat . The staff Misnah was service oriented and kind. She offered to help us customise our ala cart ordered into a meal to make it cost efficient. Cheese stick tasty.Drinks are fine. Overall we are statisfied and will return back.
Jinjja Chicken,First time at Jinjja chicken @nex.Wanted to try the food but was always crowded at peak hours.I was served by Roy & Sally.They are very friendly & helpful.Great food & service.Thumbs up:thumbs_up:
Jinjja Chicken,My second time came here and it’s better experience compared the first time when I’m here. The food being serve hot and it taste good. In the picture is WingsBap Combo in SoyGarlic it came with a fries add Egg for $1.30.The staff were polite however you do need to wait for a while for the food to be serve but it worth the wait.
Jinjja Chicken,"Order all these for $30. Mozzarella sticks nicely fried. Fries with tteok quite a small portion and must mix well before eating cause the sauce is at the bottom. Beef bulgogi gimbap is the must order, simple yet hearty. 12 pieces of wings (soy garlic and yangnyeom), crispy and well coated! Their wings are pretty good and not dry."
Jinjja Chicken,Will always other the promotion set 12 chicken wings at $10.90. super worthy. Add on one meal set will definitely full for 2-3 pax. Love it
Jinjja Chicken,I had bad experience with them yesterday (10th April) About to break fast and when my daughter open the packaging and saw the Mozarella Cheese Stick in black colour.  My daughter was so shock and she thought that me and husband order the wrong food.  My husband went back to the Northpoint outlet and inform the staff the mistake that they did.  The Malay staff explain to my husband that this month they are using charcoal cheese stick.  But why in the 1st place we are not been informed and there is no initiative in doing any refund at all. This is consider cheating!!  There is no service recovery when the mistake been done by Jinjja staff. 8pcs of cheese stick that I order end up in the dustbin.  They do not deserve to get even 1 star..No star at all.
Jinjja Chicken,"We love the food here but there seems to be a problem with the management. Always run out of Tofu, Salad etc. We were there on Monday at 9pm and we were told that the Outlet is closed and not accepting any dine in. How bizarre is that? Where does it mention that there is no Dine in at 9pm?"
Jinjja Chicken,"Place is nice and clean. service is really minor, but this is fast food style. But a bit hard for new customer. But food. Really good. Very worth the dollar."
Jinjja Chicken,"Got the drumsticks mix - preferred the yangnyeom sauce to the soy as it was much tastier. The chicken was lightly seasoned, and the batter was crispy, but I have had more tender meat elsewhere.  The fries were underwhelming, so I do not recommend getting it as sides."
Jinjja Chicken,"Visited on a Saturday around 4pm. Was not crowded. The staff was friendly. Great atmosphere and food. The menue was extensive too. I tried 1. A special Lunar new year set ( includes- kimchi fried rice, fried mandu, spicy k chicken drumsticks, seaweed flavoured fries, large lemon tea) 2. Beef kimbap  All the food were very good, my favourite was the k-fried chicken. You can select the spice levels for the k-fried chicken sauce, falvour for the fries, size of the drink. Recommend!"
Jinjja Chicken,doufu salad is nice! got a lot Korean food choices and good memory with this store
Jinjja Chicken,The customer service here is very nice and enjoyable. The malay auntie here have a very nice mood and really sets the atmosphere to make us happy. Really make us happy after a long day.
Jinjja Chicken,"Surprisingly an enjoyable dinner. Had 12 pcs chix on promo, really worth it. Chix has some crunch and well covered with sauce. Beef noodle was good too, although on the sweeter side. Will be back if we crave some Korean chix."
Jinjja Chicken,"The chicken was very good and very crispy but very salty. The chicken is tender, better than KFC’s dry ones. Service was good but slightly slow. The atmosphere was quite nice, but very less seats. Hope they can add less salt when making the fried chicken."
Jinjja Chicken,"We came to dine in at Sengkang Grandmall Jinja Chicken. I really commend the prompt service provided by Ms Mulan. You have a winner’s attitude, and we appreciate the fact that you take your customers seriously. All the best to you.. :smiling_face_with_hearts::smiling_face_with_hearts::smiling_face_with_hearts:"
Jinjja Chicken,"The manager Mulan is very warm, friendly, super helpful & cheerful. It was our 2nd time there and it’s always a pleasant experience."
Jinjja Chicken,"Had a great variety of salads, noodles, fried chicken and sides to choose from! My partner absolutely loved the kick from the Monster sauce on their signature drumsticks!"
Jinjja Chicken,"Good food and great atmosphere. We're lucky to get the seat that faces the jewel inner waterfall. It was quite relaxing. Overall the food is okay, you cannot go wrong with the Jinjja chicken wings. We also tried the Rabokki, it seems like an instant Rabokki. But overall its tasted good"
Jinjja Chicken,"My go to joint for wallet friendly Korean food.  Had the beef ramdon $11.20 with a set. A beef kimbap $9.60 +$4 for popcorn chicken and drinks and tteoboki $3.90.  Kimbap is very good. Refreshing and much better then expected. Popcorn chicken is a very generous portion for an add on and definitely value for money. The ramdon was good but we kinda wanted something with soup. Tteoboki was sweet as well and decent portion sized.  Overall, satisfied with the food that served here."
Jinjja Chicken,Very nice restaurant located at level B1 in Jewel close to arrival gates from Terminal 1  Burgers are very tasty. Really recommend the Kimchi Tofu Burger and Chicken burger  Seaweed fries are very nice.  The staff is very professional and food is quite fast to be serve.  Few seats to be able to enjoy lunch quietly.
Jinjja Chicken,"The staff here are polite and nice.  The Tofu Bibimsalad surprisingly refreshing and nice. The rest of the deep fried items was nice but I personally find the sauce a bit too salty to my liking.  The reason why I rate it 3 stars instead of 4 stars is due to an unfortunate i consent at payment. The staff do not seemed to be familiar with the Kris+ payment cos they insisted only can use it to pay for certain items. Since there was a long queue behind, we decide not to argue with them but pay the rest of the items with a credit card."
Jinjja Chicken,Love the chicken wings and medium spicy was perfect for me . Self service and food was served quick during lunch time. It’s also Halal certified.
Jinjja Chicken,The food tastes amazing and freshly made. The ambience is great too as they play kpop songs for the vibes. Mdm Ng was really nice too and helped with the utensils.
Jinjja Chicken,"The food is Good and service is superb .The cleaner lady ,Mdm Ng is very hardworking, make sure the place is tip top condition and Cleaned for the next customer to used."
Jinjja Chicken,I ordered the tofu salad and it tastes so good! Very good portion with fresh vegetables. Tofu is fried to a nice crisp. I ordered the beef bulgogi burger for my son. It's quite spicy but he persevered becos it's too tasty. So point to note if you can't eat spicy food. The service staff is always friendly. We have ordered frequently from this outlet on Saturday afternoon and the lady at the counter is always full of smiles and patience. Their jinjia chicken wings and beef bulgogi gimbap are a constant staple for us. There's also a cleaning auntie who is so helpful. She will remind customers to take serviettes after taking their food.
Jinjja Chicken,"small dining area, avoid peak hours. food was great. delivery would take so long hence better to dine in."
Jinjja Chicken,The staff mdm ng is very welcoming. She works hard and keep the restaurant tidy. Food also quite nice just a bit hot while eating inside
Jinjja Chicken,"Nice place, tasty food"
Jinjja Chicken,Tasty noodles
Jinjja Chicken,
Jinjja Chicken,
Ela,Wonderful dining experience. The spicy feta has a surprising but delicious kick. The eggplant dip is very aromatic with a hint of char. Both dips were excellent. The lemon chicken was juicy and tender. The lamb wrap was very well balanced between the melt-in-your-mouth shredded lamb and the crisp veggies and tzatziki. And finally the two best dishes in my opinion - the whole grilled sea bass and the octopus. Both prepared simply so that the natural flavors come through. Expertly grilled to charred perfection. I will definitely be back. Well worth the trip out to west Singapore!
Ela,"Never tried Greek food before, something new and different. Was here to celebrate my mum's birthday. Lady staff was so helpful with surprising my mum with the birthday dessert, 5 stars for her! Didn't manage to get her name. Thank you! :smiling_face_with_open_hands:"
Ela,"Some hits and misses with the dishes. Really Iiked the pita bread with the different dips and the halloumi chips. The sea bass was tender, fresh and not dry; the rest of the seafood platter was below average, so I suggest just getting the sea bass on its own. Moussaka and chicken wrap were not bad too. Forgot to order the octopus."
Ela,"Overall,  Spicy feta cheese dip - came w garlic pita (which was DELISH!). ordered it once I finished the dip..it was that good. Although I must say the second one has VERY LITTLE dip. It's like they ran out or smth..  Calamari - give this a miss. Not worth price not stomach space.  Paidakia (grilled lamp chops) - gooood!!! Meat was juicy. Would have preferred more lamb taste but this is good for ppl who don't like the gamey taste.  Xiphias (swordfish) - YUMMMY! THIS WAS MY FAV. The fish had a very nice char and was a thick good cut. It was really good.  To note, if ordering dip and mains, select rice pilaf as you may end up w too much pita.  Rizogalo (rice pudding) - good!  They need more staff. Like at least 1 more. The staff are doing their best but theres just not enough and you can tell it's quite hectic for them.  We had a pram and the waiter sat us right where the utensil station is. Not a very wise choice due to the noise and fact that he had to keep going there whenever there's a new table or cutlery needed. The pram took up his space so it wasn't as smooth for him either.  Oh wells~  Wld be defo be back for the food!!"
Ela,"Forgot to take photos before eating so that’s why not so nice.. but the food is nice! We ordered grill chicken, sea bass, fries, greek salad and pita bread with sauces and it was just nice for 4 adults.. definitely will come back again :smiling_face:"
Elfuego,"I have never experienced good western food in halal restaurant but this is superb for a lunch break.  I love the duck and the dessert.  Simple and no frills. This is what I would want for a luxury lunch but with affordable prices.  Service was definitely good  Atmosphere and ambience was nice. Cosy, friendly and spacious.  They make an effort in their design and seating arrangement. That doesn't mean cramping many patrons to earn more money."
Elfuego,"I’ve walked past this restaurant several times but had never tried the food due to the sheer number of options in Jewel. I finally had a chance to do so yesterday with my Muslim friend and was pleasantly surprised by the quality of food served. The salmon and sea bass were cooked beautifully; tender and moist inside. I’ve had overcooked salmon many times before and I got to say this branch of Collin’s got it right! The sauces accompanying the fish were also well-balanced and complimented the dishes well. We loved the wagyu beef croquette hot starter: tasty and crispy, perfect way to start our meal! Would definitely return again soon to try other dishes. Kudos to the chefs!"
Elfuego,"It exceeded my expectations in every way. The food was surprisingly delicious, with flavors that left me craving more. The presentation was impressive, and the staff was friendly and attentive. I can't wait to come back for another delightful experience. Highly recommended!"
Elfuego,The set lunch is very fantestic. It's really worth to give a try. Service provided by Mrs. Jascinta is really amazing. Very warmth and friendly. The atmosphere is very peaceful.
Elfuego,"Took the 2 course set lunch, value for money. Not the biggest portion but definitely a good portion to save some room for dessert after. The seafood here is fresh, highly recommended. My friend tried the Hokkaido Scallops; cooked to perfection, tender, juicy and buttery soft. I tried the Red Prawns; bright flavors, succulent and refreshing. The Barramundi flaked beautifully, with a nicely crusted skin. The Beurre Blanc was so decadent and rich. The slight tang elevated the freshness of the fish."
The Halia,"lovely experience dining at the Halia! From service to food, everything exceeded my expectations. Though my company of 4 were seated outside, none of us got a single mosquito bite. We loved duck, chilli crab spaghetti and salmon. Portion was surprisingly large! Every dish was pleasantly nice. We loved it here, will highly recommend everyone to try after a walk in botanic gardens :smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes:"
The Halia,"The food here is fantastic. They are masters with flavour and use of herbs. It’s so in line with the whole experience of dining in the Botanical Gardens. For starters, the Octopus and duck are a must try. For Mains, get the scallops (they come with Barramundi). Both are great and served with beautiful balsamic vinegar (not the supermarket kind)."
The Halia,The food was average at best. Really nothing to shout about. The service was good tho. We got some cakes to try out. And they deducted one of the cake because it's a birthday event. So that was nice of them. We got the jug of iced peach tea. It's not that big to be honest. I could finish it on my own. The chilli crab pasta was average. Could probably get it somewhere else at a better price. The black pepper glazed beef cheek was the best thing we had so far. Would recommend.
The Halia,"Super delicious, juicy, succulent Little Joe Gunpowder Rump Steak, it is heavenly at every bite! The sauce is to die for, good portion size as well for a first class dining experience. Well flavoured for my option of medium rare steak. Will come here again(after my bonus)! Pricey but it is worth it for such quality food and steak. The chilli crab spaghetti is super delicious as well, not stingy with the chilli crab meat! Great memories here! Thank you Halia team, great service too!"
The Halia,Food surprisingly very good. (No bugs or mosquitoes throughout my dining session. Thumbs up)
Afterwit Bar de Burrito,"Cool place for Mexican food! I love it! Food are made fresh and served hot! Staff are nice, helps to clear finished dishes promptly. Chill vibes! Will come back again! $41.80 for a drink and two dishes."
Afterwit Bar de Burrito,"Went in to try their food as the ratings were good but when we entered during the late noon timing the staff that approached us had an unhappy face and the way he showed us to the table was impolite, the gesture was not good and so I left the place although I was really excited to try their tacos and wings but through that experience I was sure the poor service just wasn't gonna be worth the try this time. Probably might try it some other time and give a better review, just not this time due to the unpleasant welcoming."
Afterwit Bar de Burrito,"the food is great, just a little bit too salty for my liking. the main (birria) was like a snack and would have been better if the taco was crispy. the snack was like a main (enchiladas) and this was too salty for me. the place was insta worthy just that it was quite hot inside but service was amazing! 6.5/10 would go back:sparkles:"
Afterwit Bar de Burrito,"we made a reservation for 3 people, for 1:30pm.  2 of us arrived a few minutes before 1:30pm. we told the staff (twice) that we had a reservation for 3. they didn’t have space for us, so they shifted another customer from their two-seater table to seat us.  we informed the staff that we had 3 people (not 2), and the table only sat 2. the staff told us that once our third friend arrived and space cleared up, they would move us to a table with more space.  our third friend arrived shortly after, but there was still no space, so we had to stand around and wait. the staff then moved the same customer as before to another table, so they could join two tables for our party. if you’re going to take reservations, then make sure you have space to accommodate the reservations without having to ask other customers to move.  we ordered the all-you-can-eat taco buffet, which is not really all you can eat, but just 6 tortillas, some meat, & a toppings bar. they also make you pick between chicken, lamb, or beef, and you cannot mix the meats.  we were told there would be a 25 minute wait for our food, but we waited for more than an hour before our tacos arrived, because they ran out of tortillas.  +1 star only for the nachos given to us on the house because of the delay.  the tacos were alright - lamb was under seasoned, beef was decent. the toppings bar was in shambles by the time we got to it. the promotional posts on their social media promises 5 toppings and 6 sauces. the toppings bar we got only had 3 toppings and 1 sauce. it was quite a bit of food in quantity but the quality was lacklustre and we left quite unsatisfied :/  please, do better."
Afterwit Bar de Burrito,"Mole chicken was delicious, juicy chicken paired with basmati rice and fresh salsa and yogurt. Burrito was so so. Hot sauce was one dimensional with lack of kick. We also ordered the mocktail but it was not worth it."
Wakuwaku Yakiniku,"They are actually open during this Phase 2 period!  Was there at 7pm - they didn't accept reservations on the day itself due to it being fully booked until the 12th of August - which enticed me even more to give it a go. They have a queue system by Chope at the front, which allows you to book your seat in advance, stating the number of pax coming. They even allow you to order ahead of time prior to sitting so that you can salivate to the delicious menu even before you get to have them.  After obtaining your seat, they prepare the bbq grill and the beef fat which serves as the butter for cooking. Within minutes of sitting, the food was already served and the waiter even went through the different cuts of meat that had been ordered.  Admittedly, the bill was abit costly, it wasn't with quality meat which we have ordered many of. My suggestion is, if the wagyu meat is sold out, the next best meat to have is the prime ribeye which was melting in my mouth at the end and savouring its every taste.  The bill was about 150 for 2, which we got a platter, unagi, 2 bowls of don and drinks and of course a succulent plate of prime ribeye (really to die for).  Cheers to this restaurant, great service,  will definitely be swinging by soon for more!"
Wakuwaku Yakiniku,"Looking for a great restaurant for a birthday dinner? romantic dinner? or even just craving for a satisfying meal? Just come here guys, best meat served… easily cooked and 100% worth your money. Been here 4 times and they never disappoint"
Wakuwaku Yakiniku,"Small restaurant, decent food though abit expensive. Limited sitting on 2nd floor so better to call for reservation for 90mins timeslots."
Wakuwaku Yakiniku,Been here several times and I'm always amazed at the food. Feels like the cow was beautifully grown:star-struck: The platter is a must with whatever add ons that you enjoy. Personally love the Jo Karubi while my partner enjoys the Beef Tongue. Pair it with the Osmanthus Tea and you'll have a lovely and delectable meal. Hands down one of the best affordable Yakiniku out there.
Wakuwaku Yakiniku,"One of the rare halal Yakiniku restaurants in Singapore. Do check out their meat platter with 5/7 types of beef parts. There are some exotic parts such as beef tongue which is for the adventurous. The sides such as potato croquettes, chicken karaage are worth trying too. They have a strict dining policy which is that reservations are only for 5pm or 6.30pm, and they expect the whole group to be present before being seated. The restaurant occupies 2 floors but the lower floor is more of a delivery area and kitchen, so seats are limited."
Kohnangkam,"My family and I were looking forward to having an authentic Thai dining experience, but unfortunately, the dishes turned out to be overly sweet and lacking in the expected spice flavors. Moreover, we experienced slightly slower service due to our seating on the second floor. On top of that, the utensils were not properly prepared and had noticeable stains, indicating a need for replacement."
Kohnangkam,"Alhamdulillah 3rd time with the family here. We had set C of siakap fish 3 rasa, which was cooked to perfection, black pepper beef was a wonderful treat cooked in the most delectable sauce, the tom yam soup gave me a kicker which I was pleasantly surprised as I dont normally eat tom yam, the omelette was so fluffy my 9 yr old niece loved it, I also did not expect to enjoy the mango salad but it was superb too!  Ps I hope my mak ulong does not see this but the ayam goreng was ayoyo!  Definitely recommend to halal food goers and foodies alike. Just look at the photos!"
Kohnangkam,Tom yum noodle was bleh. Came with 2 prawns and 2 squids. Didnt taste like tom yum. It was just sour. Cant comment abt service cos the waiters just serve you your food since ordering and payment were thru online. Restaurant ambience was quite 1990s. Wont come again.
Kohnangkam,"Very affordable halal Thai food in town, prepare to book before going to avoid disappointment. Staff was nice and friendly but tad little under attentive which could've been improved.  Generally food really for value and affordable, works out to 25/pax with the set meal and get yourself stuffed!  Highlight was definitely the green curry chicken and steam fish. The sotong in the tom yam was good too. Fried chicken has a good crisp but tad too dry."
Kohnangkam,"Ordered their set A for breaking fast. The 3-rasa fried fish is good. So were the milk teas. All properly sealed with no spillage.  The clear tom yam sup is a tad too salty, probably due to the cook preparing d dish during fasting period.  Dine in there a few times prior to this. Always fully booked. Delicious dishes too."
Monster Planet,"Placing order from the QR code they provided, and the portion from the photo looked small, but turn out the portion was huge; and I shouldn’t order the side dish. I was stuffed. The taste was good, nothing to complain; service was also good, great environment. Just the price was slightly higher but still acceptable."
Monster Planet,"Massive portion that can feed 2 persons!  Pretty empty and not crowded at all. Quick to get served and arranged for seats. Fast service - served drink and soup efficiently.  Lunch deal is a value! For $0.50++ extra, you get drink, soup and ice cream.  Not bad, can try."
Monster Planet,Huge portion of food and tasty too! Ordered the 2 - 3pax on the menu which could easily feed 4 adults. It was a very satisfying meal.
Monster Planet,Ground staff mentioned only 1 staff. Under staff but service is fast with a quarter of shop seated on a weekday lunch. Chicken katsu not as expected but big fish is unexpectedly delicious. It is nice to end the meal with haagen-Dazs ice cream. Recommended big fish curry.
Monster Planet,ordered the chicken cutlet and beef patties for takeaway.  both takes time to prep but worth it.  chicken  cutlet level 3 tastes better than the beef.
Monster Planet,"Big portion size of flavourful curry and toppings. The chicken is especially juicy , tender and comes without the skin (much appreciated) ! The spice level in the curry can be controlled and adds a nice punch to the food. The service was fast and efficient. The bandung drink however was a bit too sweet. Do note water is charged."
Monster Planet,Decent quality curry spot. The portion is huge. Which looked even more monster sized by the giant plate it’s served on. The curry and rice covers about a third of the plate :grinning_face_with_sweat: Do note that the hot sauce is the little heart drawn on the curry so don’t go get a mouth full of it if can’t handle spice.
Monster Planet,"Love this restaurant so much! In addition to good food, the services are great, and the staff are friendly. It's so nice to get to dine in here.  I have gone the one in Jewel, and it was awesome. This time I have project in Orchard Road, and really glad that Monster Planet have outlet here. Really love this restaurant. The food is superb!"
Monster Planet,Good food and amazing service. today we break fast there and the waitresses really accommodate our needs. didn't expect the meal portion really big and please our appetite. thank you so much :)
Monster Planet,"Halal Japanese Curry!  Food size good to share between an adult and a child. Service is wonderful as food came quickly (yes, there wasn’t much of a crowd) and staff are kind. Sitting area allocated to us is spacious since we had small children with us."
Monster Planet,"5 star for service, after placing my utensils, they slide down to the curry sauce. When I was trying to take it, the staff readily give me replacement even without asking! Food was nice, and quite thick Salmon meat cut. Overall, pleasant experience :)"
Monster Planet,"The restaurant food are nice and tasty, especially the toast ice cream. The staff name Janice is a very friendly , helpful and nice person. Her service is great! 5 stars :thumbs_up_light_skin_tone: up!"
Monster Planet,"The food is nice and portion is huge, able to last the whole day. Will be coming back for sure."
Monster Planet,Love the halal version of Monster Curry they offer alot king ebi prawns curry rice ! Price is reasonable for the large portion. The chicken terriyaki was very crispy and tender too hehe ^^
Monster Planet,"Friendly staff, freshly prepared food. Portion is huge. Love their food."
Monster Planet,"If you're looking for a hearty and satisfying meal, the Steak Japanese Curry Omelet at Monster Planet Jem is definitely worth a try. The dish features a perfectly cooked omelet, filled with juicy and tender slices of steak, all smothered in a delicious Japanese curry sauce.  The standout feature of this dining experience was not just the delicious food, but also the attentive staff who provided great service. They were friendly and accommodating, and the food came relatively fast, ensuring a positive dining experience.  Overall, I would highly recommend the Steak Japanese Curry Omelet at Monster Planet. It's a great choice for anyone looking for a filling and flavorful meal that's sure to satisfy, with the added bonus of excellent service from a well-trained staff."
Monster Planet,The food was as per usual monster curry standards. Extremely big portion and you’ll get sick of it at the end. But craving will be back in a couple of weeks/months.  The staff was very attentive and quick. The place was at full capacity and they decided to sit 2 of us at the table for 4 and informed us that they might split the table if required.  We can tell that the staff are happy working there. One of them was doing the Naruto run around the restaurant and it was hilarious.
Monster Planet,Lee was super attentive and very accommodating to us as it was dinner for break fast. Service was surprisingly very fast and prompt. Importantly the food was not cold. Manager was apologetic for the wait and said that they tried their best.
Monster Planet,"A wonderful meal here. The staff and service were amazing and accommodating, as the meal was on the late side due to us coming at the tail end of lunch, the manager Mr Mako was still accommodating and friendly. Food was fantastic as usual and consistent to the other location we went to! Highly recommended!!"
Monster Planet,"Plate is ginormous, serving is quite ordinary. Curry not spicy for a level 5. Well served by Marko."
Monster Planet,"We tried out their set meal. It's comes w soup, main, drinks and ice cream for dessert. The portion for the main dish is too big. Good for big eaters but it's waste for others. My colleague and I didn't finish both of our main dish as we're already very full. But overall, it was good."
Monster Planet,"Was there with colleagues for lunch, and was delighted with the variety of food choices. The set meal is was a catch which includes a main of your choice, a soup of the day, a drink, as well as a cup of ice cream (we've got chocolate flavor which makes all of us happy). The portion is good for hungry souls and big eaters, we are all bloated after the meal. The meat was not greasy, its fried to a just right tenderness keeping it juicy and crispy on the bite. The curry was flavourful but abit too thick. Overall, it was a nice meal at the store and will definitely be back again for the pocket friendly set lunch. Recommend to add cheese and omelette to your curry rice, you will like it for sure. :face_savoring_food:"
Monster Planet,"The curry katsu sando set is not value-for-money. $8.80 for half a sando, one mini triangular hash and a bottle of apple juice. Def not a hearty breakfast"
Monster Planet,Big servings.
Monster Planet,the food taste great and the staff are very friendly!!
Monster Planet,"No regrets at all with choosing this place, the staff were incredibly attentive and generous! The food was top notch and serving sizes were very abundant! The plate was bigger than my head and I have never felt more full and satisfied after. Also, they are proudly a halal establishment which is very inclusive and helpful."
Monster Planet,First time i had japanese curry rice. Not bad. But it will be a long time until i come back again. Most of the servings are for 2-3 persons. And i usually eat alone.
Monster Planet,Excellent & Friendly Service by Staff Ahmad. Food was good and generous for my whole family. Worth the price. Definitely will come back again. :smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes:
Monster Planet,"The outlet is much smaller than the one at Paya Lebar Square so it might not be a good choice to dine in for large groups. Probably max 6 pax. Most of the seats are catered for 4 pax. We got the curry combo for 2. Definitely enough for 2 pax unless you’re super duper hungry. Also tried the raspberry lemonade which was not that sweet so it’ll be great option for the health conscious. Spicy level 3 was really not spicy in my opinion. It felt like level 1. So for those who love spicy, go for the max level."
Monster Planet,"Very friendly staff, the the food was delicious. Big portion! Definitely recommend eating here! Plus it is certified Halal food"
Royz et Vous,"The restaurant is conveniently located near the MRT station. Visited on a weekend afternoon and it was empty, there’s also an area to store our stroller. Love the food options, definitely recommend the fried mushroom, fish and chips, and nacho chips! Went with a group of 7 friends and the serving was large enough for us to share. But I noticed that there was only one staff serving in the whole restaurant, so might be good to assign more staff, especially on weekends."
Royz et Vous,"1st visit to Royz eat Vous with 8 of my colleagues. Most of us had full course with a drink, appetizer, main course & dessert. Food was really yummy. Portion just right for the price tags of most our selections (total bill came up to be arnd $650). Rahid, guessed is the restaurant manager, started to comm with me via WhatsApp text about a week prior to our dinner. He was clear & responsive in clarifying the queries as raised:thumbs_up: The only not too nice part of the whole dining experience was that 1 of the female service staff, she was quite rude and impatient when serving us with the drinks and food. Other than that, Rahid & the other male service crew were great :smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes: Special commendations to the chefs & staff working behind the kitchen for the yummy food that were presented to our table :two_hearts:"
Royz et Vous,"One of the rare halal places around town so we came here for team lunches whenever we have the opportunity.  The food is decent usually but today, the wagyu burger was tough and didn’t hit the spot. I would come here for the lasagne, the starters  are pretty good too.  The other star was lost on prices. A can of Perrier here is almost $7. That’s a major markup but they serve free tap water which is a plus.  All in all - 4 stars."
Royz et Vous,"fantastic and pleasant dining experience here, will recommend to others and come back for sure! from reservation to payment, it was a smooth process and restaurant was considerate to take pre-orders to ensure our meals were served timely when we reached the place. staff even gave us a complimentary truffle fries! thank you so much :heart_hands::heart_hands: special shout-out to their special asam boi mojito tea, absolutely splendid and refreshing!"
Royz et Vous,What can i say? Awesome food and great service. This place is perfect for booking for large groups ie company dinner. Must try Beef short ribs. Melts in your mouth. But be warned its a big portion. The picture doesnt give justice. Overall an awesome experience.
Royz et Vous,"Simply amazing place!!! I love everything so much! The quality of food and portion is super worth the price l, and I adore their iced chocolate a lot! The potato and asparagus for the chicken parmigiana was cooked perfectly and the sauce are all unique and special! A good place for a good gathering, and their sides are huge for sharing. Love this place and hope to come again!"
Royz et Vous,Place around has plenty side and public carpark. So accessibility is quite convenient for drivers. Food was great. Ordered striploin and was cooked to near perfection. Black Forest and the sides are great as well. That is except the truffle fries. The truffle topping is quite generous but the fries itself is normal. Service wise I had a mixed feeling.I have seen 1 or 2 employee walking around and not sure why I was told to wait but they could be seen standing there not serving customers. Waited quite awhile after a few hands up and eye contact before we was being entertained. But later on they served us fried calamari which we told them we did not order and they still gave it to us as a complimentary dish. We were all pleasantly surprised. Would still come back again if we are dining with my halal friends.
Royz et Vous,Food was delicious! Friendly waiter and the ambience was also peace! Had a good nice dinner gathering with my family of 11 pax.
Royz et Vous,"Amazing portion + delicious tasting food! The sides are really meant to be shared :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing:, definitely can’t finish by a small group.  + point: The lady owner (I believe) will walk around regularly to check on her customers to ensure they’re happy with their food."
Royz et Vous,"First time at this outlet and I’m glad the standard remains consistent across the outlet. The eggplant parmiagiano was the delicious vegetarian dish as usual, power packed with flavours while remaining low on carbs. We had 3 portions of the strip loin steak from the seasonal menu as the flavouring and doneness was perfect, one of the best halal steaks we’ve tried. Service was good for a busy weekday night."
Suki Suki Thai Hot Pot Buffet,Manager Theva was very accommodating and friendly to my family in assisting us with a birthday celebration. We are all very happy with him and his crew services. Job well done !
Suki Suki Thai Hot Pot Buffet,"Service was good! Always helping out to clear the empty plates and also checking in if everything is fine.  Food was average. There should be more choices of marinated chicken & beef. However, whatever given was simple and full-filling as well.  My friend and I came with the restaurant almost empty which is a plus point for me cause I would prefer it to be less crowded. Atmosphere was good as well."
Suki Suki Thai Hot Pot Buffet,We came in a big group to celebrate someone’s birthday. This kind and energetic staff named Margaret were constantly checking up on us and making sure our experience was nothing short of perfection. She always looked out for the needs of the table and never fails to smile and make all of us happy. She is definitely an asset to this company.
Suki Suki Thai Hot Pot Buffet,"Great experience dining here . The managers Theva & Raf were very customer-oriented. Flexible & very accommodating. Both had great interpersonal skills , observant & went all out to make my family’s birthday meal gathering that much more comfortable. Thank you also to Muhammad & Mann for being efficient & friendly . Despite all wearing mask , my family and I can feel their warmth & see their smize ( smile with their eyes = smize )"
Suki Suki Thai Hot Pot Buffet,Came here as a family with young children. We were served by Wei Jie and Raymond and our time here was pleasant. The duo were really great with kids and their customer service qualities were top notch! I would definitely come back with more friends and family next time
Suki Suki Thai Hot Pot Buffet,"There are plenty of varieties of food to choose from. In terms of the soup base, really enjoyed the tom yum soup which complements the food that we chose. Would like to also compliment staff Shidah who was very friendly and accommodating. She was very attentive, attending to our table promptly and checking on our needs. Thank you for making it a pleasant dinner for us! :)"
Suki Suki Thai Hot Pot Buffet,Had a better experience than last year. Prefer to choose my own ingredients rather than staff getting from us. Shidah service is impeccable. Reminded us that our dinner is an hour as we were using birthday perks. Kept checking on us and made sure we had enough food. Only if most service staff has her personality and kindness. I’m definitely coming back next month for another meal. Hope to meet shidah  again. Thank you very much
Suki Suki Thai Hot Pot Buffet,Theres alot of varieties of food to choose from. Delicious soup! Shidah was very helpful and attentive at our table. She and the staff are all very friendly and always put a smile! Thankyou so much for the awesome service! :D
Suki Suki Thai Hot Pot Buffet,"Basically it is a hot pot buffet with sliced cuts of beef and chicken.  Meat is sliced thinly enough such that a few swipes in the boiling soup cooks them nicely to remain tender.  Though limited, there were other items like veggies, mushroom balls/cheese balls/sausages/ taupok/noodles etc for the hot pot.  There are a few soup bases to choose from too.  Honestly we were there for the beef and chicken slices as we couldn't achieve those thin cuts of meats by ourselves if we were to buy and eat at home. Only need to note that the fish paste is way too salty even after cooking in the soup for quite a while. We were very thirsty after dinner.  There were quite a few sauces and condiments for you to make up your own favorite dipping sauce.  The desserts are limited to some small cup jelly, cup ice cream and some sliced fruits.  Lemon tea is also way too sweet for my liking, I mixed it with part iced water as ice doesn't melt fast enough to dilute it.  The staff are friendly and cleared the empty dishes regularly. Really appreciated that as the dining table was small for the 4 of us and we really needed the space. Note too that there is a dining time limit of 80min, last order for meats to be made at 60min.  It took slightly more than 10 mins for the soup to come to a rolling boil (but the other time we visited it took a shorter time), so it will be good to go around to make your sauces and get the other items /drinks while waiting.  Car park is quite expensive, but may park at the public car park beside the stadium which is just a short distance away."
Suki Suki Thai Hot Pot Buffet,"Nice ambience. Nice food with nice company. Worth the price as there was a 1 for 1 buffet offer. Not sure when is it ending. We went for the regular menu at about $23 per person. So for 2 it's only $23+. If you want to get the premium menu with prawns, crab and more ingredients,  just need to top up $10+ only. So depends on what you like. But the regular menu itself was filling and we enjoyed the food so much. Quite peaceful to dine in and have a good time with family or friends."
Carousel,"An old favourite. Wednesday lobster and crab dinner buffet was worth the additional price.  Lobsters and crab at the cold seafood section was fresh and sweet. Lobster truffle risotto was deliciously creamy. Laksa is good without being overly heavy.  Good spread of dessert and ice cream. Love the mango sorbet. Carousel probably serves the best bread pudding I ever had to date. Luscious, spongy,  creamy and not too sweet. End the meal with a good cup of Lavazza coffee  Replenishment was quick. Service was fast, courteous, and attentive.  Overall an enjoyable buffet dining experience."
Carousel,"Went for international buffet lunch, choices are decent, didn't manage to try all of them as half way we are quite full, suitable if you have special event to celebrate. Overall not bad but I feel the dining time can be prolong, 2 hours seems a little too short for lunch"
Carousel,"Crowded on weekend dinner. Long queue was formed even before the restaurant opened at 630pm. Reasonable variety. Average pricing with average quality. Lobsters/seafood were well stocked. Cooked crab was dry and flavor did not seep in. That said, the dessert section was above average, outperforming the seafood and the cooked food section."
Carousel,"Celebrated our sister advance birthday dinner here. my younger sister recommended this place, the food was super good and delicious. what my sister say the food very nice and delicious it really mean very good and delicious! cause she came on the last Sunday the food and all super good. I'm looking forward. but today mostly all the Asian cook food and the sea food on ice very salty and over cooked. Very sad and disappointed sent a $89 for the quality!.  Sea food on ice The snow crab leg very salty, Sri Lanka crab pincers over cooked super dry same goes with lobster pincer super dry! The la la clams super dry too!  Asian cook food side The Stingray and all Chicken quite dry! The Fish maw soup, lamb chop, prime ribs, prime ribs black pepper sauce and the mushroom sauce very salty!  The Indian food was not bad The desserts are not bad too But the fondue of the fruit not much to choose from very little variety.  This my first time here don't think I will recommend!"
Carousel,"Was here for Company Department dinner some time back.  Food wise, not bad. The lobster however felt a little too frozen in my opinion. Other than that, wide selection, topping up of food was also prompt.  Service crew did a really fantastic job in upholding the image. Always attentive & ready to help & clear your plate.  Been considering this place for my anniversary celebration while I'm typing this.  If you want great service, here's the place."
Fika Swedish Café & Bistro,"it was an unplanned idea to have our lunch here. the service was really fast & good. their food was delicious it really felt like i was recharging my soul. main dishes tasted good, apple crumble is a must try! it was so soft and vanilla ice cream was milky."
Fika Swedish Café & Bistro,"Very pleasant cafe with friendly staffs. Overall, interior is cosy and warm. Favourite dish is the apple crumble with vanilla add on. Apples are just the right size and the crumble is soft but not too moist. The temperature of the pie is just right and the ice cream doesn’t melt too fast. Very generous with the ice cream. Vanilla taste subtle and creamy perfect for sharing."
Fika Swedish Café & Bistro,"Had dinner with my partner on Monday evening. Not a huge fan of the QR menus  but the interior was amazing :smiling_face:  Food wise, meatballs were crumbly but paired well with the sauce and jam. Baked potato sides were really good :smiling_face: My steak came last and it was okay. Did not ask for the doneness upon order but I was okay with it. (Please ask if you're those who are particular)  Overall, the plating of the food was really aesthetically pleasing! Loved it :smiling_face:"
Fika Swedish Café & Bistro,"We shared the scallop salad. A delicate light salad of perfectly seared scallops accompanied with baby rocket, apple, pistachio and a mustard dill mayo. It was perfection. We kept with the seasonal menu as suggested by Azfar our waiter. We certainly were not disappointed. A delicious plate of barramundi and creamy potato mash went down a treat. The fish pie was also so flavourful and a must. The desserts completed the meal. Salted caramel waffles and the housemade brownie were a sweet lovers dream. Special thanks to Azfar. Awesome service. You are worth your weight in gold :smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes:"
Fika Swedish Café & Bistro,"Quite disappointing food for a supposedly highly rated cafe, the location had nice vibes situated right in Haji lane but the food was disappointing for the price, lunch sets were sold out too early, service was sad, they gave the wrong set of utensils in the basket and poorly made the drinks. The lamb stew was especially disappointing, bland and poor quality."
The Ramen stall,Fast service! Staff are friendly and accommodating. Food is really delicious and worth every penny. Worth to try. Would definitely come back.
The Ramen stall,"From the time we went in till we parted goodbye, the staffs were warm, friendly and helpful. The suggested meals were delicious. The broth were rich, the bbq meat were perfectly grilled. Shafie’e is a gracious host!"
The Ramen stall,"Friendly staff and loved the interior. Seated near the door and a little cramp as it was crowded.  Ordered 2 mains and 2 sides. Within 15 mins, food came one after another.  I had  the Chicken Cha Shu Ramen, partner had Volcano Ramen Level 2. Our sides were salmon sashimi and chicken gyoza.  Food was really yummy and the portions were adequate :smiling_face_with_heart-eyes:"
The Ramen stall,The food was great! Staff were nice and friendly as well. Would come back again :)
The Ramen stall,"Last minute walk in for break of fast and luckily seats are available for 2 person.. 1st time dinning here. Was directed by the staff to our seat. Ambient is good,have yet to taste the food :smiling_face_with_open_hands:. Thanks the staff crew Wong for being understanding & helpful."
The Ramen stall,Food was served very promptly. Staffs were friendly. Good place for late night supper! Reccomended!
The Ramen stall,"The food is delicious. The place opens from 5pm to 6am. Staff was friendly and polite. Service was prompt. We visited at 2am and it wasn't too crowded. Note that if you drive, there is no dedicated parking for the restaurant so you'd have to park elsewhere and walk over. Overall a great place to get late night food."
The Ramen stall,"Been here before years back, and was amazed by the food. now I bring my spouse here and it still kept my expectation of the food! Food is awesome at reasonable price (can be slightly exp but it’s affordable).  Will definitely recommend to others!  PS. To the owner of the biz, your food and place is definitely good but maybe it’s time to refurbish up abit haha. My spouse got bite by mosquito haha."
The Ramen stall,"Lovely 2 storey setup, good customer service with decent variety of sushi, yakitori and wine.  Go for the garlic fried rice, chicken yakitori. Will come back next time to try the sashimi and ramen. Reasonable pricing top.  Update: returned for the Ramen and sushi, so delicious!! Still maintain 5 stars for food and service."
The Ramen stall,"Awesome service, especially Ms. Nunu, the best server - friendly, helpful, knowledgeable. Keep it up All the dishes were great, delicious and good size too"
Badoque,"Had our company dinner here. We ordered ahead of time. And once the food is served, we feast. We had giant slab of beef ribs with accompanying sides such as potato wedges (they were crispy), sunny side up, salad, peas, and toasted bread - this is so value for money. The beef ribs were glazed with thick barbecue sauce, slightly savoury and sweet, cooked till medium well to well done. It might be better to undercook it so that it's more tender, but the juicy gelatinous fats all around the beef made up for it. Still a recommended dish given its value. We also had cake and ice cream for dessert. We cleared the dessert menu."
Badoque,"Came for dinner on a Friday evening. Food was served pretty quickly. We got 3 sides, 5 mains and 3 drinks and bill came up to $200. All the dishes served were quite good! The mojito was nice as well! Highly recommend the carbonara, laksa pasta (can be a bit oily - I scooped out some oil) & wagyu burger!! Would come back again :)"
Badoque,"Went on a Saturday afternoon about 4.30pm and we were the only ones in the place! Heard prior to going that the standard has dropped, but I certainly don’t agree with that  Food and service were :thumbs_up::thumbs_up::thumbs_up::thumbs_up::thumbs_up:  Watermelon cooler was lovely, huge portions for food and drinks. Well cooked proteins, mash was flavourful and generous with sauces! Definitely felt well taken care of dining here. Will be coming down again :) Must get: ribs"
Badoque,Lamb Shank was very well prepared and tasty. The mashed potatoes had a hummus like taste and texture. The kalamansi drink was a bit too sweet but enough quantity to be shared by 3 people.. not to forget the lamb shank had a crunchy crust at a few places which added to the experience. All in all must have…
Badoque,"First time trying here. Took a look at the menu I was shocked by the price point. But since I'm already here why not.  The Watermelon cooler arrived we thought it was for sharing. (Look at that size). The Watermelon cooler was made from fresh watermelon! Not syrup!  I ordered a Ribeye, 350g was their standard. And mind you, their portions is relatively large. If you are a small eater, i reckon sharing instead.  Overall, the service was good and friendly. Do have some paitence as there is only one waiter/server at scene."
Flavour Flings,"We came here at 2pm on a Sunday, not crowded but the service was damn slow and bad. We ordered at 2:11pm, 1 steak with 5 dollars top up for the cheese and 1 salmon. Half an hour later at 2:41pm, the food were still not here so we went to ask the staff, they said 6 more minutes. Waited for about another 8 minutes still no food so went to ask again and they replied rudely ""now, now, now!"" Ended up our food were still not here. Finally my salmon arrived, only the fish was hot, the sides were all cold, terrible! Steak arrived around 2:52pm and we had to wait another 5 minutes for the cheese that we paid $5 for. Of course the steak turned cold! Ordered medium rare, what came was medium well to well done. Come on... you all can do better, waited more than 50 minutes for trash food. My hubby ate 1 mouthful and asked for refund. Within 1 minute, the female cook came to clear the food angrily making quick and noisy moves. Wow, serve so slow clear so fast, worst service I've experienced."
Flavour Flings,"The steaks with was too salty, Raclette cheese was ok.  Lobster and Crab roll was very bad and overpriced; the sauce was bad, lobster tail portion was very small and crab mayo tasteless. Look at the picture, ridiculously small portion for the price. Better go to burger and lobster or any other places. My fav was pince and pints but they closed. Don’t waste your money here.  The carbonara and aglio olio were both too salty as well.  Overall, the food were not only very bad but overpriced at a place with too many tables packed into a small place. Will never return. Only thing is the staff were friendly."
Flavour Flings,"Attacked by their video on raclett cheese. Did not dissapoint, the steak and cheese was very nicely done, taste of beef and cheese really compliment each other. Crab roll was delicious with the melted butter. Seats are limited and by 7pm place is full, they stopped queuing as they were booked out for the night. Highly recommend securing a reservation before heading down. Aircon was very underpowered, edging towards stuffy in a full crowd. Kitchen also can't keep up with orders during peak hour, waited over 30min for food. It's a hidden gem in Hougang, cooling and staffing if improved will greatly increase atmosphere."
Flavour Flings,Went there during peak period. So there were alot of people. Highly recommend to make reservations.  The food served is amazing!. Do come here for some fabulous cheezy goodness and the salted egg croissant.  The steak here is very tender and well salted too.
Flavour Flings,"Give 3 stars for atmosphere cos the aircon almost like non-existence. Food taste is good, like the breaded crust of the chicken cutlet. However a tat bit salty for the potato. The salmon mentaiko is served piping hot but in contrast the fries were lukewarm only. The mentaiko also salty.   The mushroom soup with truffle is tasty too but seems on the watery side."
Afterglow by Anglow,"The atmosphere was cozy and inviting, perfect for a relaxing meal. The staff members were incredibly friendly and welcoming.  They took the time to give us detailed explanations of the dishes and provided us with their recommendations.  Every dish we've tried was bursting with flavors even though its vegan. One dish that really stood out to me was the mushroom balls. Its packed with savory umami flavors and the texture is on point. The cauliflower steaks were also perfectly seasoned and had a delightful char that added a smoky depth to the dish.  The friendly and attentive service combined with the incredible food made for a truly memorable dining experience."
Afterglow by Anglow,"This place is good for everyone - people on raw food and others. Everything is tasty and healthy ! Service is great and fast.  This is my third time here. The kale dehydrated chips were tasty and crispy. The raw lasagna was delicious, and as a dessert the açai bowl too was wonderful. My friends too loved the food, and the place."
Afterglow by Anglow,"Have patronized Afterglow through the years and always admired their philosophy of healthy non-fried vegan food. This time round, we had the fish burger (upgraded our fries to salted egg potatoes), cheesy kale, and baked cheesy cauliflower. Tasty and filling. Worth keeping in mind that their food isn’t fried, so the texture of grilled or baked items are different. Service was very attentive, and we like the homely atmosphere and decor."
Afterglow by Anglow,"I understand that this is a vegan restaurant but I’ve really had better. we were very excited to try the sushi but it was honestly very hard to finish the dish - the rice was substituted with almond rice and it really destroyed the experience. we shared among the few of us, and none wanted to have the last piece. I’ve had other vegan sushi’s but this rly pales in comparison, other diners probably appreciated this better since it was on almost every table - so try it at your own discretion.  the dessert was top tier though, everything about it was amazing, not sure what it’s called but would highly recommend to get it."
Afterglow by Anglow,"Our 1st time here. 1 of the owners did a detailed recommendation for me which we truly appreciate. Ambience is cosy. Food was served quite fast too! Tried the Teriyaki ‘Meat’ balls (Fav side!), hummus of the day and Spiced Fvsh Burger with sweet potato covered with salted egg sauce! (MUST TRY the sweet potato with salted egg sauce!) Awesome restaurant for vegans!"
Elemen,"Overall it’s not bad and I personally like the soup more. We went for their 5 course dinner set at 28++ per pax so each person pays about 30+ per meal which I think is considered reasonable.  But the portion of the food is on a smaller serving (at least for me). I had to order other food after dinner to fill my stomach. Love the double boiled herbal soup and the dessert is actually not bad. Unfortunately I don’t think their mains is at the the same level with their soup. At this price point, rated a 4 star"
Elemen,"Had been wanting to try after recommendation by my vegetarian colleague. Food was tasty, however, the portions were very small. Perhaps most vegetarians eat light, but omnivores like us were left feeling hungry. Wanted to order desserts to supplement our meal but did not dare to as we had already waited close to half an hour for our mains. I would say that the food tasted really good but we would not return again as portions and service did not impress."
Elemen,"Had an enjoyable experience at Elemen PLQ Restaurant. The Service was warm and welcoming, and the food was amazing! Tried the Local-Licious 6-course set menu which was highly-recommended and we were not disappointed!  Our appetites were whet and we dug into the food promptly upon serving and forgotten to take more photos!"
Elemen,"Interesting menu. From rice dishes, pasta, noodle & pizza. Nice place for a family dinner, restaurant has a pretty relaxed atmosphere.  Had the forbidden rice & it was really yummy. Nice slight crunch to it & was quite filling. Would try the ramen next time.  The brownie with vanilla gelato was better than expected too. Would come again!"
Elemen,"This is not your typical Chinese vegetarian restaurant serving vege and mock meat. Here, they offer a delectable selection of vegetarian food choices from other cultures - such as Italian pasta, pizza, and dessert.  I found the flavours of every dish to be unique, complex, yet easy to appreciate and pleasing to the eye and nose. Portions are generous for the 8 course meal per person. Will I return to eat? YES!"
Elemen,"On 5 July we went for our gathering. Dinner for 10 of us. My friend booked a table and was given a VIP room. It was very comfortable. Besides, we haven’t seen one another for quite a while so obviously we spoke a lot, laughed a lot.  With that room, we didn’t have to reconsider our voices.  The service staff named Jun (purplish hair) delivered a 10/10 quality service. He was kind and friendly.  He was flexible.  Have not seen one service staff as good as him after Covid. Really. He was very initiative. The food that he recommended were palatable and suitable to our taste buds. He helped us to take group photos. Food was really good, very presentable. All our “oooos” and “ahhhs” were aplenty. A restaurant that I highly recommended. Unfortunately, Jun is enlisting in NS soon. All the best Jun!   Attached photos were taken by my friend who took nice pics, I only knew about appreciating and eating."
Elemen,"This is one of the famous Vegetarian restaurants in Singapore.  After visiting the beautiful Marina Bay area, it's nice to take a break at the Millenia Walk Shopping Mall and enjoyed a yummy vegetarian lunch. Never imagine that the veggie food can be so yummy and good looking. The food presentation is so good. Thanks my friend Mickey for inviting me to such a wonderful restaurant. I will come back again."
Elemen,"Love their seasonal menu as there's always new things to try, wide variety of food to choose from. Service is very good and all the staff are friendly too!! Would recommend my friends to try if they haven't done so!"
Elemen,"Premium vegetarian food. Each dish is plated elegantly and tastes delicious (pardon my second photo which is half eaten). Only issue is that they seem to be understaffed so my drink didn’t come until the end with my dessert, and I also had to wait for around 10 minutes before someone saw us and attended to us so that I could ask for my dessert."
Elemen,Food and service were great!!! Very reasonable price for set menu. Top choice for modern vegetarian cuisine. Their CNY vegetarian yu sheng was the best I had for 2022! Fresh and sweet not dry and dull. Give it a try! You won't believe it's vegetarian :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing::grinning_face_with_big_eyes:
Elemen,"The 8 course is good as there are many dishes including appetizer, soup, salad, main, dessert and drink.  Very nice food for vegetarian options. Service is not bad. Recommended to get truffle pizza, tofu wild rice. Would come back here again and again."
Elemen,"Food tasted great and consistent throughout all their outlet. By far, this was the best service received compared to harbourfront and promenade outlet. We were warmly served by Kenneth, who was observant and friendly.  Will definitely recommend anyone to this outlet!"
Elemen,Delightful Asian-European fusion cuisine beautifully and creatively presented. Suitable for young and old: our party ranged in age from a young teen to octogenarians. We each had the 5-course meal and were very pleased with all the dishes.
Elemen,"Beautifully present dish with elegant flavors. Love all the dishes are natural and not over seasoned. Special mention to the great job by all 3 staffs. It was such a busy night, despite running around they perform a flawless and efficient service. As a f&b manager myself, would advice management to look into hiring more help. 100% will come back"
Elemen,Went this restaurant for multiple times for lunch. Usually we order 5 items or 8 items course as we can select dishes from many options. Seasonal course menu is also nice. Somehow sometime they serve dishes too fast while eating. I hope they will see progress and serve dishes at right timing.
Elemen,"Element really strikes out differently from the other vegetarian restaurants.  Working on the concept of using only natural vegetables (there are no mock meats as far as i know), the elevate the dishes and flavors to the next level.  The flavors are intriguing on the taste buds. What you see may not be what you think it is. It is definitely not bland in all ways.  The menu of 8 course was worth the money. Needless to say, the service was also top notch.  Definitely a place worth coming back to. If you are new to this place, its worthy of your time and money to come try."
Elemen,"Great place to go for your vegetarian meals. Such colorful and variety meals that makes eating vegetables a delightful experience! Well worth paying for a 5 course, or 8 course meal if you are really hungry :drooling_face: I missed out taking photos of the double boiled soup cos too busy drinking :squinting_face_with_tongue:"
Elemen,"first time here, because i was jio-ed by good friend of mine, to try their vegetarian dishes. Supprisingly it was not tasted as normal vegerarian dishes out there. Highly recommended for those who love meatless dishes. :thumbs_up_light_skin_tone::thumbs_up_light_skin_tone::thumbs_up_light_skin_tone:"
Elemen,Probably one of the best Asian food served in Singapore. 5 or 8 course is available. The portions were perfect and the food war delicious. Must try restaurant.
Elemen,Tasty food with polite serving staff.   Serving was fast.  Recommend Spinach mushroom pizza and brownie with vanilla gelato. Abit of surprise when paying bill with cash and was told to be paid exact amount as they have no change.
The Boneless Kitchen,"Went for a vegetarian meal at this supposedly first Korean vegetarian restaurant in Singapore.  Food is not too bad. Vegetarian food is getting more and more interesting nowadays despite the constraints of protein flavours.  If you are around the corner, feel free to come by for a meal. ◡̈"
The Boneless Kitchen,"Exceptional Korean food at a decent price.  Food is excellent & service is prompt. Tofu soup is delicious and flavourful, with the ingredients generously portioned. Omelette & Kimbap are also great.  This is also one of the few Korean places I've encountered where the Kimchi pancake can be shared between 2 people, which is great if you aren't dining in a large group.  Definitely give this place a try if you get the chance! Be warned you may have to queue during lunchtime."
The Boneless Kitchen,"Korean food without cruelty :raising_hands: I have not been able to enjoy Korean food nearly as much since going vegan, especially without any options in Penang - but this is a total win :face_savoring_food: Everything tastes just as I remember, maybe even better :winking_face: My omnivore friend brought me here and even he adores it! Not everything is fully plant-based as it’s still a vegetarian restaurant but you still get by fairly easily :victory_hand: They even import their Cola!"
The Boneless Kitchen,The manager was patient and full of energy. Her service through out the full house was very much welcomed. The food was delicious. We had our fill with all the vegetarian options and it was gorgeous. Truly satisfied with the food quality. You don't get this kind of jajjang myun in South East Asia that often.
The Boneless Kitchen,Trying this place for first time !.. was searching something different for my vegetarian overseas guest n came across this place.. food I order was decently good but could be better.. sitting area not very large so it’s best to book a reservation which I did .. would probably want to try other dishes here another day .. also parking could be an issue during the day .. not many around this area .. I had dinner so was lucky to get a space in the next building which is the surroundings of the building.. payment is only cash which I didn’t mind..
Greendot,"Enjoyed the bento where you have the options to choose different dishes, which are delicious and its reasonably priced. Recommended dishes are Spicy Sweet and Sour Egg plant and Curry Vegetables.  I have tried the Laska Noodle, and it's really good.  The serving process for bento could be improved to reduce the turnaround.  Overall, it's worthwhile to visit."
Greendot,"Small outlet with many aunty wait staff who r friendly n caring! As d capacity is limited, dining is limited to 30 min during lunchtime so as to free up d seats to many diners. No one makes monkey head mushroom as good as Greendot. Love their sesame rice too! Bento set may b costly @$9.90 but it's a good portion with tasty dishes. No need to worry being overcharged either. Crispy wanton is a killer eventhough it's a little too oily this time. Greendot has adopted online ordering but hard copy menu is still available. Love it!"
Greendot,"Came on a weekday night for dinner and it's been a while since I had greendot. The price increase is quite significant in relation to portion size. Area is rather small and cramp and by 7pm there is already a line waiting for seats.  Quite amazed by the staffs on the ground. With an average age group of 50, they are super alert and attentive. The loyalty program greendot is doing to allow online orders is actually really confusing, especially with multiple payment vendors available. I'm surprised how the crew are so on the ball. :thumbs_up:  I ordered the Angelica Herbal Noodles and I really love the la mian texture and the variety of ingredients in this soup dish. It is a very healing and heartwarming meal that warms me from the inside. I rate: 4/5 :glowing_star:  Gyoza 3 piece was rather small and fillings were little. Pretty tasty, but would not order again. I rate: 2/5 :glowing_star:  I did not appreciate that sauces are chargeable now like Tar Tar Sauce and Sambal chilli. I'm presuming that the ingredients used are vegetarian and process is hard to make. Hence chargeable. Quite sad."
Greendot,"First time here. Ordering process was not straightforward. I could not order the light bento set through online and was directed to cashier. The staff then directed me to select my dishes so I was confused. All I wanted was the light sweet and sour soya bento set which was one main and one veg. I chose one more lotus root dish so it was $11.90. Nevertheless, the food was good. Broccoli was not oily and al dente. Turmeric rice was delicious and soup was flavourful and lightly seasoned. Would return but will insist they give me the light bento set as shown in menu. Payment and order via QR code. My friend ordered the wrap which didn't look as good as the bento set."
Greendot,"8th Dec 2022:  One of my favorite eateries that caters to taste buds for sumptuous, creative Taiwanese vegetarian foods!  I finally found a dine-in location for GreenDot after my favorite outlet at bedok mall had shifted out due to the demolishing of the shopping mall.  Not all their branches have a dine-in facility so I was eager to try out the food at this branch after we did errands at Bishan.  Prior to the pandemic, I used to recall that the soup came with a generous serving of a short piece of corn cob & substantially large piece/s of carrots at the bedok Mall's Green dot.  However, I was pretty much in for quite a disappointment when the bento set came with just soup with pathetic looking ingredients and the pricing seems to have gone up by quite alot after the pandemic.  I am still giving a 4 stars due to the fact that the food tasted more than decent & I truly enjoyed & relish every morsel of it.  The staff who attended to me at the food counter was also very attentive & helpful while I was selecting dishes for my bento set.  As the food was appetising with good service, I have decided to place another special treat for myself yesterday.  It is a pity that the buckwheat sencha tea wasnt available in a tea pot size - I used to order my drink in a tea pot style at their bedok mall outlet to go with my food.  The cashier recommended me the yam paste dessert which was delicious and highly recommended to those who has a very sweet tooth!  I would drop by again to patronise from this Bishan branch again although I wish that there was a larger dine-in space.  Hope that they can keep up with their food quality given their steep pricing.  7th Dec 2022:  I didn't like the food quality for the Greendot bento set which I placed as a take-away order on 7th Dec 2022.  The dishes wasn't as fresh & also not as palatable as it usually was.  Came across as stale & probably reheated more than once to be sold for maybe a couple of days already.  It was below par.  But thank goodness they have picked up drastically on their food quality on the 8th Dec 2022 & this was attested by a full house patronage throughout the day even when it was already past lunch hours!"
Greendot,"Generally good food, I love how they formulated their dishes to taste exactly like the meat version. Service is alright. Is it that difficult to serve the food with utensils? It increases traffic flow as customers have to walk a distance to collect the utensils when the place can get quite crowded. Customers do pay for service by the way."
Greendot,"Green dot nex serves tasty and healthy food. Hope they continue the great service and to keep prices affordable & competitive. Have ate here several times over weekends and can be quite crowded after lunch time.  Really tasty food, except the prata was burnt on the part facing the plate.  They were really busy during weekdays and weekends during meal times as well."
Greendot,"Typically, I go for the signature herbal soup noodles which is lighter on the palate. Besides that, my favorite is the rendang when I am craving for something heavier. As usual, it is very flavorful and salty.  Many a time, I just hope the taste can be less salty and oily, likewise for the other dishes as well. For the bento, I will rinse my food in the soup to get rid of the excess oil and saltiness.  Prices have increased quite a fair bit over the years due to inflation and rise in costs. Also, the menu has expanded which is nice. Nonetheless, not a bad dining choice.  Service in Nex outlet is ok."
Greendot,"I really enjoyed the food! I’ve tried the herbal soup bowl, Laksa and Taiwan spicy noodles. Their handmade noodles is just on point. It’s springy and chewy. I did try their dessert - Banoffee pie parfait. Well, their flavour was alright but I just hope that the cream texture can be a bit more dense and moist so that it goes better with the banana and nuts.  The auntie servers here are really kind and friendly. Offered to help me top up hot water for my roselle tea even without me asking. Very sweet of them. Thank you and keep up the great service:)"
Greendot,"The ingredients are nice! The laksa noodles are over-cooked. Soup is mediocre, not bad but not tasty either. Queue is endless, even though I avoided the lunch crowd and came at 2pm. Will try the Bento next visit"
Greendot,Great food for vegan and vegetarians. Laksa is my all time favorite and I go there very often for it. Herbal soup is another gem
Greendot,"The food and customer service here is excellent; value for money, and I highly recommend this place to all vegetarians who like Chinese cuisine. The ambiance is lovely; the perfect place for a meetup."
Greendot,"It seems that low quality meat dishes have replaced good quality fresh veg in nearly all the shopping centers these days!  Thankfully, Greendot is close by and both vegetarian and vegan friendly.  Easy to find, on the fist floor of PLS, above monster curry.  I normally have the 3 veg bento box, which comes with a choice of 3 rice options. White, brown or sesame.  All the veg are cooked so well, with plenty of bite and flavour. For a special treat, I'll have the lionsmane Randang which is delicious.  Price is very reasonable for the quality. 3veg bento 8.50, Randang 11.50  The deserts are pretty good too!  To top it off, the staff are very friendly and always have a smile.  Highly recommended, just save some for me."
Greendot,"Visited today, Sunday around 3pm and ordered our usual stir fry mushroom & veg pot with sides of gyoza and sweet and sour soya nuggets. There wasn’t much people in the shop, and was expecting service to be fast but it took about 20-25 minutes for the food to arrive (-1 star). The uncle that served the food was friendly so thumbs up for that. However, we were sorely disappointed with the food. The standard isn’t consistent as last time. This time the stir fry mushroom pot was oily, and there weren’t enough vegetables. Instead it was filled with a lot of the “fake meats” which are basically soya filled (-1 star). Would be a while before I will patronize again"
Greendot,"Greendot is vegetarian cuisine. The taste is good and the price is considered affordable(i ordered mala for 2 people at 33SGD|include with drink) depending on the menu you are choosing. If you are bored eating protein or you want to find vegetarian or become vegie persons, try this place really recommended"
Greendot,"This dish is so special. (hainanese curry Crispy Beancurd Skin Rice). It's something new which I never try before. The rice is  sesame rice, with is fragrant and tasty by itself. When the rice mixed with the curry, it's just made the taste perfect. The potato cube is a little too big for me, which I have to cut to smaller piece( which I felt it's quite worth it for the price). The service is good, I did not meet any attitude cashier( as other review). The shop is quite small, which has limited seat available."
Greendot,"28 Nov 2022: A rushed dinner. I always get the rendang monkey head rice and it never fails me. Soup has suddenly become strange (seaweed, too much ‘seaweed salt water’ taste). Will try something else next time.  17 Feb 2023: Tried their set meal with… 1) braised lion mane mushroom with signature rendang sauce :thumbs_up_light_skin_tone: 2) braised QQ tofu with shimeji mushroom & black fungus:thumbs_up_light_skin_tone: 3) stir fry broccoli with black fungus & mushroom 4) braised pumpkin with goji berries :thumbs_up_light_skin_tone: along with fresh sesame rice (which was AMAZING and fragrant :blossom:)  I don’t know why I’ve been eating green dot as bento sets! They are amazing in sharing plates, taste better :-) their sesame rice tastes better with the lionmane mushroom in rendang sauce (rice is silky, rendang creamy, best combi!!)  Please go try Greendot in this form. You won’t regret it!!!"
Greendot,"Small outlet, with limited seatings. A good place for vegetarian food. Selection of rice or noodle dishes. Washed down the food with their osmanthus jelly drink."
Greendot,"Decided to go healthier option, so me and my friend decided to go for greendot. The staff at the counter taking our order was not so helpful or friendly. Attitude issue.  Food was okay."
Greendot,"I had the QQ tofu bento. The sesame rice was very fragrant tho a tad tough. Still tasted good nevertheless! The veggies tasted great too, not too oily or salty. The tofu sauce went so well with the sesame rice it's almost addictive. Would love to try other items on their menu. Restaurant wasn't crowded so my food came very fast too. Pricing wise I personally feel it's quite reasonable for the quality and selection of vegetarian/vegan food. Overall very good experience, thank you!"
Greendot,I’ve been here several times and am always looking forward to dining here! The matcha desserts are phenomenal! I’m always amazed at the quality and can’t believe it’s vegan. Pricing is affordable 8-15 sgd per person when you sign up for the membership.

Greendot,"I've dined at other Greendot outlets before, and was pleasantly surprised by my experience (weekday night) at this one!  First, as pointed out in an earlier recent review: ""Apart from the standard menu, Greendot One Raffles Place now has a new Wazen 和善 (Harmony) menu"". Didn't see this being offered at other outlets.  Second, the staff did not chase us away at 8pm (listed closing hours) despite us not finishing our food yet. They went about their business cleaning the area, etc, but left us alone to continue talking and finishing our food. When we were done, they kindly came over to help us clear the table and did not chase us away.  As with other stalls/shops in the CBD area in the evening times, there is not much foot traffic, and I got to enjoy my dinner in peace. The trade-off is that there's a chance that what you're looking to order may not be available in the evening. In my case, brown rice was not available at that very evening."
Greendot,"Apart from the standard menu, Greendot One Raffles Place now has a new Wazen 和善 (Harmony) menu created in collaboration with Veg-An, featuring authentic and delicious Japanese vegan and allium-free food! Exclusively available at this Greendot outlet so I would highly recommend visiting! Do note that it is only available 4pm-8pm on weekdays and 11am-8pm on Sat. Btw the staff at this outlet is exceptionally friendly too.

Greendot,"Not too bad la, like all other greendots. Nice for vegetarian food. Especially like the mushroom rendang and was kind of craving it. So can't complain!"
Greendot,"Great place for vegetarian options. Would recommend the mushroom rendang. The rendang is quite flavourful and tasty would prefer if can add the sauce on the rice as well. The fish sticks are okay, doesn't have the fish flavour, slightly sweet. The laksa was nice, have similar taste to actual laksa with the lacking of shrimp flavor. Overall a good experience, might have to wait a while for seats as the sitting area is quite limited."
Greendot,"Food is very delicious. The sever at the cashier is one of the most cheerful and heart warming person. She even recommended me base on my personality. Their moto: EAT GREEN, FEEL GOOD. I had a good vegetarian meal of my life."
Greendot,My wife ordered the pumpkin soup based yong tau foo today. It was very bland without any chilli sauce being served to her. So i walked over to request nicely for some chilli sauce at their counter but was shocked to hear from the staff and the manager that the boss of Greendot insisted that customers have to pay additional $0.30 for a little bit of chilli sauce which we needed for the YTF. Why make customers pay additional when your food are already all overpriced? This is such a horrible experience!!! We really cannot believe that Greendot is so profiteering!!!
Greendot,"Location: (+) Very accessible.  Environment: (+) Bright and clean.  Service: (+) Prompt service. Despite the crowd, one auntie made space for me immediately when I was still considering if I should eat there. (+) All the aunties serve with a smile.  Food: (-) Skipped the bento because every time I buy, they are always cold. (-) The laksa has mock meat which is made of mainly flour and is tasteless. Would prefer more whole food like vegetables."
Greendot,"Very delicious vegetarian spot, even my father who doesn't like veggies fell in love with the rendang! Pumpkin side dish is absolutely amazing.  Love the complimentary soup and fruit juices they give when ordering delivery from Grab. But maybe my stomach's a bit sensitive, always get diarrhea after eating from here, hence 4 stars."
Greendot,"It’s a pick up place. I ordered online Tuesday night for Wed pick up at 1115 to 1130. When I arrived at 1130am I was told to wait for my order to be served.  I didn’t observe any action on my order so I asked the staff, who didn’t have any prior idea of my order as it had not been printed out automatically.  Staff didn’t seem to be willing/or capable to check system for my order. I pressed her to check. They weren’t unpleasant, just seemed to insist that if the printing didn’t come automatically, they wouldn’t move. When we found the order in the system, cashier said she will print for me and couldn’t tell me how long I needed to wait.  They were preparing orders which were received this morning ahead of my order which should have been queued. I got my food at 1146. Once again: They weren’t unpleasant or unhelpful just flustered and ill equipped.  My yong taufu with meepok n special sauce was tasty. For $10.90 it did feel abit steep with just four pieces of ytf: mushroom, taupok, capsicum and one more I can’t rmb. Lots of green leafy vege in noodles and in the soup. The dry meepok was springy even after I got home. The special sauce tasted good but was fridge cold (not sure if it’s meant to be this way?) the clear soup was tasty felt healthy with carrots and xiaobaichai and geiji bits.  Thanks for quick reply from mgmt. I Hope the ladies get some support for their new menu n the order system"
Greendot,"One of the healthier options available in the neighborhood! As a mother, I am always happy to feed my child lots of greens and healthier items that actually taste good, and Greendot is an establishment that allows for me to do that. Pricing wise is definitely higher than your usual economical rice, but then again, Greendot’s ingredients are very fresh and they don’t scrimp on portions, so we are happy to pay.  What we usually order for pick-up is the family bundle on their website, and just look at the generous potions given! Missing from photos are soup and dessert. The lion mane mushroom rendang is a must-have, and the konnyaku fish fingers taste just like commercial fish fingers except that it is vegetarian. Very delicious indeed. My son loves the QQ tofu as well."
Greendot,Ordered all my dishes payment was fast but food service was slow. The staff was busy packing grab food order and for giving food which are ordered later than me first. When come to my turn told my veggies was out and have to just wait. Stood for 20 mins and told me want to change dishes as another one of the vegetables only jus started to cook. All the while serving other online orders while totally ignore the customer infront.
Greendot,Very nice vegetarian. Portion good. Price reasonable in shopping mall
Greendot,"The young lady at rice counter dont allow me to pick my bento dishes, she asked me to order my bento dishes at payment counter. Worst service! How can we order bento rice without looking at dishes?  Then i ordered; rendang curry brocoli Baised mushroom  And when i reach home, i found out they gave me Rendang curry Curry potaotes Braised Taukwa  I dont get what i ordered! And their service is bad!"
Greendot,"Ì that Greendot runs their outlet at Asia Square so efficiently as there are not much vegetarian around that area.  Their menu is quite extensive as well. If the queue gets too long, you can also scan the QR code and place your order and pay online and then just wait for your number to be called.  I have several favorites, like laksa, Taiwanese noodles & Hor Fun!  Atmosphere, I rated only 3 stars because it's located in a food court. Gets pretty noisy and crowded during lunch time."
Greendot,So ran over to ASia square at 3:15  because I absolutely love green dot and wanted takeaway for dinner.  Google states that it closes at 4:00.  At 3:21.  I walked up and was told they close at 3:00…so many times I have attempted to grab green dot and location has changed or they close early…feel sad because I love the food and the concept.
Greendot,they’ve just opened last week and i’ve had lunch there three times :face_with_peeking_eye: i guess that speaks volumes
Greendot,"A vegan stop on the 1st floor of a food court in the business district. Fantastic Lions Mane mushroom in a thick curry sauce, you have to try it! Also super vegan Laksa soup."
Greendot,
Greendot,Been here a couple of times and will revisit whenever got craving! Does not taste like vegetarian food cause everything very flavourful and with strong marinate/sauce. Love the curry mushroom & brinjal!
Greendot,"Nice place to have new-aged vegetarian food. Pity, they do not offer Tomyam noodles anymore. But, they have new dishes in their menu, e.g. the wrap."
Greendot,"Had the lion's mane mushroom rendang with turmeric basmati rice. The rendang was amazing, absolute must get. Greendot is always a consistent, well priced meal option for me."
Greendot,"Taste of food gotten better to last time when they open on Level 1. Family went there to eat, ordered their burger, herbal soup yong tau foo, laksa & some beancurd as sides.  Food portion is good, not small. Filling. Taste is good, the herbal soul taste great.  Servicing is also fast. No complain.  Only thing I can feedback is that they sitting area is quite small, compare to when they were are level 1, can be hard to find seats when it gets busy. Other than that it's a place I would recommend."
Greendot,"I was never moved by eating clean in my diet. This is one of the place that change my perspective and taste buds of eating green and feeling good.  I can say that this is my second time here having their Bento set. - Firstly the price is decent , value for money . -Secondly the portion is worth the money I'm paying for. Fills up a hungry tummy. -Lastly the service.  Enjoyed being served by the 2 young older in age lady. They were welcoming and friendly , they have good sense of humour too haha . Appreciate it; to the team serving around 8.30pm @Northpoint:)  I definitely enjoyed the meal after a long tiring day . I feel good."
Greendot,"Walk in on a Saturday afternoon at around 4pm plus, there was not much crowd and some seats are available.  Ordered the crispy beancurd skin bento set and was served in less than 10 minutes.  The food is tasty and delicious and customer service is good.  Will return to dine in again."
Greendot,Came here recommended by my friend. Impressed by the rendang sauce on the mushroom set ($11.90). Will probably visit for some small bites hehehehaw  Place is well lit and can order via QR code.
Greendot,"Greeted with friendly waiter when stepped into the restaurant, and the waiter will assign us a seat.  Once we gotten a table/seating, next is to proceed to cashier to place order and make payment.  Ordered vegan hor fun, its very tasty and tasted like the actual non-vegan hor fun.  Will revisit this outlet in future."
Greendot,"First time trying vegetarian food. Not a fan of it. Laksa wasn’t really flavourful. Their prawn balls tasted real tho. Price inclusive of GST, slightly steep but laksa and the side dishes were below $10 each."
Greendot,It’s my first time trying Greendot’s vegetarian food. My friend recommended me to try the bento and i’m blown away by how delicious vegetarian food can be. It’s truly an eye opening experience! The curry dish is made of Lion’s Mane mushroom and it does taste a little bit like chicken.  Service is excellent and staff were helpful with the change of seats once the air conditioned seats are available.  10/10 will come back again to try other dishes.
Greendot,"I’ve always been a fan of green dot. But this outlet utterly disappointed me.  Charred broccoli that tasted bitter. I think they could do better. Brown rice was the saving grace. Grain by grain, all cooked.  Sweet sour beans, some of the sauce were still in chunks. It tasted heavy and uncooked. Gosh I wish I could return. But my lips say no."
Greendot,"I had initially requested a rendang bento, but I received a wholesome green bento instead. When I asked if I could choose the side dishes, the person informed me that I could choose three. I made my selections, but when I started eating, I realized that I hadn't noticed the mistake, so I partially blame myself. Later, when I asked for regular rice, they responded by asking what I meant by ""normal rice."" This frustrated me, and I replied by saying I wanted white rice.  Hello Miss! Wake up leh don’t dream.The service person really needs to be more awake.  Overall the food average"
Greendot,"———Location :round_pushpin:——— Located besides the newly open hadilao in Jurong point, so don't be surprised when you are there, you are not lost my man, it's really just besides there. In other words, the restaurant is very closed to the taxi entrance.  ———Atmosphere :cloud:——— As mentioned above, it is very close to the taxi stand, so it will be more noisy.  ———Food :bento_box:——— Similar to the menu in JE greendot (cause both are greendot), food is as amazing as always.  ———Service :man_tipping_hand::woman_tipping_hand::person_tipping_hand:——— Less servicing, less manpower.  ———Pricing :money_bag:——— Good pricing, good portion.  ———Miscellaneous :glowing_star:——— NIL  ———Overall :OK_hand_light_skin_tone:——— An amazing places to pickup vegetarian food:smiling_face:"
Greendot,An all vegetarian place that serves up local delicacies alternating with healthier options. The offering are good and price is reasonable. A lot of vegan options as well. Laksa is the most beloved and it’s good but still could be improved as you can see inconsistency in the two bowls (one with too much noodles and with lesser) Burger is a good option too and lot of sides including the soy nuggets and gyozas that we tried.
Greendot,These are the vegetarian meals which I have tried so far.. nothing to complain about the food :face_savoring_food:
Greendot,"If u like n need to eat vegetarian, Greendot s one of e pla e to go. Tried their off menu dish, pumpkin gravy yong tau foo. Not bad."
Greendot,I love the chill vibe of this branch. The Ipoh Hor Fun is superb with the wantons super crispy and the sauce super delicious. The warm yuzu drink is nice. Comfort food.
Greendot,"Taste great , vegetarian lovers there , good place to hang out. Keep up the good work  2nd visit yesterday, crowd is getting more service team able to keep up the pace, well done. Food is up to standard, can tell why so many customers Q up and Q up for takeout.  I would like to suggest to the green dot management to consider put up a digital Q number system instead of the service team to call-up the numbers with loud voice, abit too old school, may not be too nice for the dinning in customers.  Keep up the good work for promoting vegetarian food."
Greendot,"Never thought that vegetarian food could taste this good. I love coming here for the laksa yong tau foo and the taro cake is to die for. The taro paste is very pure and thick with a hint of natural sweetness. Overall, the cake was also soft and not dry at all.  Highly recommend and great place for a casual meal!"
Greendot,"I ordered through Grab for Tofu Bento set with Sesame rice but received Sweet & sour nuggets instead. Very much disappointed with the delivered order. After paying so much, we don't get to receive what we order."
Greendot,"Cheap. Yummy. Quiet (at least for today). Fast. Wonderful place to be at for dinner. This particular outlet has vegan desserts, and it was superb. We got noodle dishes, both were great. And then the Exotic Chocolate tart for dessert. So so good."
Greendot,"A nice addition to the Chinese vegetarian/ vegan food choices at the airport. Like its other outlets, the dishes are tasty. It has more food variety compared to the other Greendot outlets like the pastries and some local delights with a little twist."
Greendot,"Great find for vegetarians and vegans alike. This is the only fully vegetarian / vegan restaurant in Jewel. Located nearest to Lobby H lift, B1 level - next to Macdonald. Clean hygienic dining area. Menu is extended with set deals compared to other Greendot outlet. There’s choice of local food, burgers and wraps. A fancy cake and bakery corner that’s serves all vegan fresh bakes. Oat milk is available for your cappuccino too. Order through QR code generated when you sit-in. Staff are accommodative and service delivery is prompt."
Greendot,"First visit to their new outlet at Jewel Changi, my wife is a supporter of Greendot, they serve dessert at here as well! And the vibe of restaurant is relaxing!"
Greendot,Surprisingly the price is reasonable. Rendang curry chicken only $10.90 (befor GST and service charge). My wife ordered herbal soup noodle which we always did when we visited GreenDot. Food are tasty and consistent. Same taste like other outlets.  Another thing to mention is their friendly service. The crews here are polite and attentive.  Would definitely visit again when come to Jewels.
Greendot,Absolutely love the desserts here. I almost can’t believe they are vegan. The shop is tastefully located in Paya Lebar Square. To order for events need a 3 day notice. The packaging for the to-go desserts is done well compared to other shops in Singapore. Well worth the price of 9-12$
Greendot,All vegan :smiling_face_with_heart-eyes:  Love the Belgium Dark Chocolate Cake. Very rich. The chocolate donut was great too!! Heading there soon to get more sweets
Greendot,"My friend ordered a small cake for me to celebrate my birthday and I really enjoyed it! As someone who is lactose intolerant, I often find it hard to buy cakes that I can eat without worrying about the price and ingredients. I think Greendot offers something tasty and good price with cute packaging too. The collection process at the store was smooth and fuss-free!"
Greendot,"Newly opened in June 2022, Greendot Patisserie has a takeaway concept and is located on the same floor as Greendot Restaurant so customers can dine-in there. Not just beautiful but taste and texture-wise also among the best vegan cakes I've eaten, even my non-veg family and friends approve! Love the fun size 3 inch cakes which look like mini whole cakes and are good for 1-2 pax. Alternatively, 6 or 8 inch family size cakes can be pre-ordered 3 days in advance. There were originally 5 flavours available but new flavours have since been added! There are seasonal specials too for festive occassions like Christmas. All made using natural ingredients like flowers, fruits, nuts, seeds, and oats with a healthier concept; no preservatives, artificial colourings, or flavourings.  - Papa Mocha Ganache Cake: Coffee and cocoa-infused sponge layered with mocha cream and rich dark chocolate ganache, topped with a housemade dark cocoa bite (made using 70% dark Belgian chocolate, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and almonds) - Lady Roselle Strawberry Pistachio Mousse Cake: Pistachio and hibiscus sponge layered with butter caramel cream, strawberry puree, roselle strawberry mousse, and roselle jelly - My Mango Fantasy: Lemon sponge with mango slices, mango puree, and mango konnyaku jelly - ILY So Matcha Azuki Cake: Bittersweet sponge made using premium matcha powder, studded with oat mylk white chocolate chips and azuki red beans - Little Ms Bluetiful Coconut Cake: Soft sponge naturally coloured using dried blue pea flowers, smothered in mildly sweet coconut custard cream with coconut shavings - You Are My Passion Cake: Spiced carrot cake sponge layered with vegan butter cream cheese frosting, topped with crushed pistachios, almonds, and blueberries - Singapore Pandan-stic Cake: Moist gula melaka sponge smothered in aromatic kueh-style pandan kaya curd, decorated with pandan coconut whipped cream, toasted coconut flakes, and coconut shavings - Summer Love For Yuzu Cheesecake: Smooth no-bake tofu and cashew cheesecake infused with citrusy and tangy yuzu puree and lemon juice, paired with sweet and juicy Japanese Shine Muscat grapes, strawberries, and blueberries encased in a tall layer of firm lemon konnyaku jelly - Pink Fairy Raspberry Lychee Yule Log Cake: Christmass 2022 special! Vanilla sponge layered with lychee fillings and raspberry compote all on a base of almond nougatine, topped with a delicate vegan macaron"
Greendot,"The matcha red bean cake was amazing. It's pricey but for a special occasion, it's worth it. The lady who served me was very friendly as well. I would definitely visit again."
Lucky Cat Vegetarian/Vegan Café,"It's located inside Hougang Community Centre. Food are delicious. Various reviews recommended Tofunagi Maki so  decided to try; indeed very nice. Lucky Jjamppong (vegetarian seafood yellow noodle soup), it's noodles are smooth and silky, soft and a little chewy, very unique noodles, it's not those typical yellow noodles. Soup based a bit spicy only (spiciness 3/10). Shitake Cream and Cheese, rich cheese taste. It's a small eatery place; limited seats, air-conditioning environment. Clean and well ventilated environment. Would definitely re visit. Customer service are great. Staff are quick to clear up the tables. Free drinking water."
Lucky Cat Vegetarian/Vegan Café,This is the kind of place you want to patronize for good quality Japanese vegetarian food and prices at quite decent. Doesn't break your wallet. Sushi is a must order. Teppanyaki rice was excellent and the bowl of salad were freshly prepared. Had 2 cups of nice latte. For 2 paxs it cost $42
Lucky Cat Vegetarian/Vegan Café,"Great place for vegans to satisfy their comfort food cravings! Katsu curry was the tastiest dish. Tofunagi sushi a bit too sweet but I really liked the tofunagi. The avocado salad had one whole avocado in it! Everything only $32, no service charge or GST."
Lucky Cat Vegetarian/Vegan Café,Food is not bad but curry is too sweet for my liking... Queue is super long during dinner time.. Have waited for more than 30mins before I'm seated...
Lucky Cat Vegetarian/Vegan Café,"There's a beloved community cat at Hougang CC, and maybe hence the name. But the cat is not only the lucky one, for vegetarians living in the north east or east hungry for Japanese cuisine are also lucky. The portions are big, and don't forget to order the Sushi :sushi:. Allium free! :partying_face: Highly recommended."
Original Sin,"Ambience - The restaurant has this very European, relaxed vibe. Good for families but I don‘t see why you can’t go for a date either :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes:  Food - my friend and I ordered the halloumi salad and lasagna. We really enjoyed the meal, the ingredients were good quality and food was prepared with care. However, did feel the halloumi was a bit too salty. They have a variety of Mediterranean and Italian options and can make it vegan too. Didn’t really enjoy the rose though.  Service - prompt service and the staff were polite and friendly  Would definitely return again."
Original Sin,"Have been here 3x over 5 years and they've evolved into a full vegetarian Mediterranean restaurant. It's okay. I wanted to try the platter.  Food: 3.5/5 Pizza, pasta, platter... the ingredients felt factory made. Or made in big batches and kept for re-heating. I might be wrong. It seems to be underwhelming for the prices. My taste buds weren't that excited by the combinations.  Service: 5/5 Attentive and polite crew :thumbs_up:Thank you.  Ambience: 4/5 indoors It was a hot day. Cushioned seating, spacious enough for wheelchair but stairs around the area makes it challenging.  Cost: $80+, 2pax, 2h"
Original Sin,Just went here for dinner yesterday and we were surprised with the food quality. I really like the king oyster mushroom with potato. Rate 5 stars for the service too. The lady who station outdoor is very nice and helpful. I forgot to catch her name. The food came quite fast even though the restaurant seemed busy. Highly recommend and we will come back again
Original Sin,"was blown away by the variety of the food served here. we had the risotto and cauliflower starter - so shiok. would recommend hanging here if you’re looking for kickass vegetarian food, didn’t think about meat once.  also, the location & ambience is pretty sick too, so just go and try pls. ty"
Original Sin,"It is the first time i’ve visited Singapore and decided to try Original Sin. From first glimpse of the restaurant, the design of the interior and exterior is beautiful. The tiled tables add a beautiful touch to the outdoors. The staff is very friendly and provide a great atmosphere in the restaurant. I am unable to eat dairy as i am allergic. I thought I would try the food here since it is vegetarian and I hoped they’d have good options for me since it is often difficult to find. Of all the dishes i ordered, none of them disappointed. The chefs were able to make each dish entirely lactose free (even the pizza!). I got the impossible pizza, risotto, and truffle fries. Each of which were used with dairy substitutes. The impossible meat on the impossible pizza tasted so good I completely forgot it wasn’t real meat! Overall it was a great experience between the restaurants culture and the spectacular food. I will definitely be coming back before I leave."
VeganBurg,Really liked the creamy shrooms burger!!! But I’d have to say that the sauce was the MVP — not so much of the patty and the bun. Truffle fries went soggy fast and not worth getting.  Would try once more if I lived nearer but wouldn’t go out of my way to try it.
VeganBurg,"I got the Barbeque Bacon Burger with the seaweed fries. The fries were great you can’t go wrong with an order of those. The burger was pretty good too, I really liked the sauce and toppings, but I think I’d replace the patty with the impossible burger next time. Still I appreciate a good vegan burger joint, as they’re somewhat few and far between. This place is definitely worth a visit."
VeganBurg,"I've been visiting VeganBurg for almost a decade and the quality is consistently excellent. My favourites are the classic Cracked Mayo and Shrooms Burger, as well as their lemonades. I enjoy the ambience too, with wide floor-to-ceiling windows which let natural light in."
VeganBurg,Impressed with the mass order for more than 50 pax of different sets maintaining its taste/appearance for smaller take out orders! All were neatly packed in boxes and drinks sealed.
VeganBurg,"Came here on Father's day cum Father's chinese birthday. Food is nice, looks very alike to real burgers and platter as you can see from pics. But everything is vegan!  Moreover, today in lunar calendar is 1st of month where one believer would eat vegetarian or vegan for the entire day typically on 1st or 15th of each lunar calendar month.  Highly reckon anyone whose vegan or non vegan but would like to explore vegan food to try out this place. Only thing is if you drive, it's difficult to park unless you don't mind risking parking in one of those landed properties. Location is also somehow in between 2 mrts (eunos and kembangan). Bus could be another option as its near the main road with bus stop just within 100m walk. Cheers"
VeganBurg,"Not sure what the bad reviews are going on about, maybe the weekend crowd differs dramatically. Came on a weekday evening at regular dinner hours (about 7+) and didn’t need to wait for a table. I guess the burgers did take longer than regular fast-food joint ones but then again this isn’t exactly McDonald’s, nor does it pretend to be. I caught glimpses of my satay burger ($17.90 with seaweed fries and a ginger lemonade) being carefully assembled in the kitchen, and was quite alright with the 10~ minute wait it took to put the meal together.  And the burger was GREAT, no complaints whatsoever — satay sauce tied every component together decently. Obviously I’m no vegan food connoisseur but as someone who really appreciates animal protein this felt like a decent alternative to have, if only occasionally."
VeganBurg,"Atmosphere was alright, didn't had any issues with the service either. However not really sure if it was a rare occurrence but the signature cracked mayo burger tasted different from Eunos branch? Also, more than half the cup were fillled with ice.. Personally, I  do not really like the chicken buffalo burger. There was a pretty corner that sells merchandise.  Price was around $15+ per set."
VeganBurg,"Came with 13pax to celebrate Mother's Day at the new VEGANBURG woodleigh. The new Chikn buffalo is very good, looks also interesting with pink sauce. All commented the burger standard is up for sure. All taste good!! Everyone enjoyed the food here.  As the place is quite new, some items are still not available like the favourites shrooms and BBQ burgers. Ordering is only via kiosks, so a little patience still needed lah while people trying to figure out how to order. Starting time is 11am. So don't go too early! The placed filled up fast once opened."
VeganBurg,"walked into this fast food looking joint and decided we should try some vegan burgers. for two pax, we ordered the cracked mayo burger and satay burger with meal. waited a good 15-20mins from order to collection. i had the cracked mayo, it was crunchy and yummy. tastes like the Macs Filet’oFish honestly, but better; fried more crunchy. i tried my partner’s satay burger.. it was ok, nuts in burgers just not my thing i guess. The patties are soy based; chews and looks like meat. It doesn’t get 5 stars due to the waiting time and misleading interior design that  communicates that this is “fast food” place."
VeganBurg,For those of you who are a guilt free burger but still has good flavors and texture. We tried the buffalo and Hawaiian burgers. Bothe will satisfy your burger cravings but still reward your healthy lifestyle. We also tried the carne asada fries with cheese and vegan meat and I have to say pretty awesome for what it is.
Pano Kato,"Really good gyros pita and tzatziki! They also have very refreshing Greek wine and beer. Some of the wait staff are very friendly and helpful, some not so. Could be a bit more attentive too."
Pano Kato,"The food is almost excellent, except the meat platter had some flaws where the beef was overcooked against what we ordered. The fish and the three dips with pita were excellent - must-try options. The salad was refreshing; I liked the sauce. A star was taken away for poor service provided."
Pano Kato,"We showed up without a reservation and they were kind enough to offer a table if we were out by a certain time for the table's next reservation. First of all, the gluten-free options are awesome and the number 1 reason we picked this restaurant.  The gluten-free pizzas were amazing. I enjoyed the crust, the flavors were perfectly complimentary and I felt the ingredients were the right proportion (as in they did not skimp to save money). The hazelnut brownie was delicious and I appreciate that they did not skimp on the roasted hazelnuts. The Lemon drizzle cake was a little dry but the flavor was spot on. The employees were kind and helped whenever we had a question. You just get up and pay at the counter when you are done. We never felt rushed and there was a pleasant, relaxing vibe/atmosphere."
Pano Kato,"Great lunch place, food is tasty and portions are generous. While food came out very quick, service needs improvement, no table touching, or offer to refill drinks, or checking on the table after food was served. While the setting is nice it might be too noisy for a quiet chat."
Pano Kato,"Ordered the dips with pita, lasagne and seafood platter.  :check_mark_button:: the pita was nice. Chewy and soft, and paired well with the three kinds of dips given. I enjoyed the lasagne. The cheese was generous, and the ground meat was tender, sitting in the tomato paste with the right amount of sweetness and tanginess.  :cross_mark_button:: I thought that the barramundi fillet would be de-boned, so it was strange when I found a bone within the meat. After removing it, I looked through the remaining portion without spotting any. The moment I put into my mouth and tried to swallow the meat, I felt the prick and immediately spat out the fish, it was another piece of sharp bone. It would help to indicate on the menu or verbally remind the patrons about that.  Service wise, it was alright, without any value-addedness not major issues. Staff could do better with more smiles."
Smoocht,Lovely vegan place I wish I went to sooner during my trip! The olive vegan bowl was nourishing with the scrambled tofu tasting uncannily like scrambled eggs. The star was the fluffy waffle with the amazing ice cream they have there. As a vegan I'm used to eating sorbets or overly sugary ice creams but this one was creamy and tasted so good! Highly recommended.
Smoocht,Great news for vegan lovers another great place to have your healthy meals here. Found this place by chance while looking for something to eat and happy we have make the choice .
Smoocht,"Ordered their truffle porcini fungi mushroom pizza with cheesy broccoli and soba. The portions were big and the ingredients used were very fresh. Highly recommend the soba. Their ice cream was also perfect and the cafe had a peaceful ambience to it. Overall, the food was worth the money."
Smoocht,One of the few vegan restaurants I have been to and not surprisingly one of the best ones. Food is a bit on the pricy side but it all makes sense with the quality and quantity. I highly recommend the ice cream of all. I couldn’t believe it was vegan. The pizza is truffle cheezburger pizza and the appetizer is smokey tater tots. Yet to find my favour dish here.
Smoocht,"really bad experience with the food.  i can’t say for the rest of their item but i ordered their waffle ice cream & it was horrible.  1. service was extremely slow when i came in, there were 5 tables in total, 2 of them had their food served already. 1 of the table is a couple who ordered an ice cream cone. my table was the first to order among the 3 tables, yet i was the last to receive and for just a waffle and ice cream, i waited for close to 25mins. We were sitting on the table right infront of the ice cream booth so it was very clear at which point of the time our food was being prepared.  2. ice cream was of really bad quality.  i wouldn’t be so unhappy if the food tastes good and the waiting time is long. but no, this is by far my worst experience with waffle ice cream. Waffle tasted like those supermarket ones where it is thick and doughy, even though colour wise it look like it’s cooked with some brown patches. ice cream texture tasted like ice blended drink poured onto waffle, ice cream was not smooth at all.  i’ve attached a picture below: i’m not sure how can the waffle be white and brown at the same time. and yes, that’s how the ice cream looks like.  i was sharing with another friend and both of us agreed that it’s really bad and that we decided to leave the place after eating 1/4 of the waffle and 1 scoop of ice cream. in fact, the waiting time was LONGER then the time we spent eating the waffles ice cream  We did see some good review of the waffle but sadly ours turn out this way, looking at the pictures of reviewers’ waffle really made me think twice if we were eating at the same place. This shop has a high google rating but sadly i’ll have to give this a 1 star."
Genius Central,It was a really nice place to enjoy it with your family. Many were also studying there as well. The staff went out of their way to provide us with everything we needed. The food was very nice as well. Overall definitely a 9/10 restaurant! :thumbs_up::beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes:
Genius Central,"Lovely place with lot of vegetarian or vegan options. It is located in the CBD area in a heritage building. The ambience and service is very nice and the food is yummy. We ordered red Thai curry and rice bowl, falafel bowl and Mexican quesadilla. Every thing was perfect. Will revisit very soon. Do remember to make a reservation"
Genius Central,"The falafel bowl was yummy and the portions were surprisingly big. The salad on the side did not have enough dressing and was a bit bland to eat. Nevertheless, the food was satisfactory! The service was attentive but we did feel a bit rushed with the staff checking in very frequently."
Genius Central,"We decided to give this place a try for breakfast as part of our stay at AMOY next door, and it did not disappoint! My eggs on toast came with a tasty melange of pesto, arugula, mint, and other flavors, and my wife's potato dish was just as hearty and delicious. We were worried we wouldn't get enough protein since this is billed as a vegan place, but they do include eggs (or options that include yogurt, peanut butter, etc), so it turned out to be plenty hearty enough."
Genius Central,"This is a great working space that only requires you put down a $35 tab for 8 hours, definitely a good bargain. And with plenty of good vegan options to choose from it's been my favourite places to work out of!  I love how they've added more vegan options to their menu. So far so good!  I recommend their asparagus and cashew soup"
Potato Head,"We had dinner at the rooftop. Food was great & so was the ambiance. Music was just right for the vibe, not so noisy so we can talk without shouting to each other. Highly recommend roasted broccoli, mala chicken & their burger.  Interior design of the other floors r very interesting. Definitely want to comeback"
Potato Head,"Potato Head has the most beautiful beach front as compared to other hotels and resorts around Seminyak. Staff are attentive, a great place to chill for the whole day. Spectacular sunset."
Potato Head,A hamburger does not have to be huge to taste awesome! Milkshakes good too. Indulgence pure in a historical building.
Potato Head,"Went there mainly for drinks at the rooftop. Atmosphere was great, love the spicy beef satay. I had Zombie and the classic G&T, but I cannot comment much about the drinks as i am not an expert there except i like how the drinks were displayed, e.g. special cups/glass per drink."
Potato Head,Staff is nice and polite. Price is on high side. Do not order watermelon man unless u want to eat a sweet burger. :smiling_face_with_tear:
Two Blur Guys,"Visited for dinner. The place is well lit and peaceful. Recommended for solo or group. You can even bring your pet. You can order and while waiting, you can play some cards or board games. We ordered their juicy burgers and sides. The burgers are 5/5, you can request it to be divided into bite size pieces. The taste is really good. Overall, it was a good experience and we will definitely come back for their burgers!"
Two Blur Guys,"Satisfying juicy burgers! Visited for lunch, convenient roadside parking at the storefront or open carpark was available behind the shop. Smart move of allowing your customers to enter from the back of the shop!  We tried their signature burger and truffle burger, the beef patties were juicy and cooked to perfection! The buns were so soft and the sweet potato fries were yummy. Set meal was worth it with cup ice cream included, many flavors were available to choose from. We enjoyed our lunch!"
Two Blur Guys,"Ordered the signature burger and truffle egg burgers, the patties were juicy and buns were nicely toasted. Topped up $3.90 for salad, fries and ice cream but the salad turned out to be a few green leaves (not the classic salad with purple leaves) & truffle fries were disappointing. Ice lemon tea was kinda decent"
Two Blur Guys,Burgers are not bad. However i found the portion size a bit small for the price paid. Each burger is $20 after ++. Well buttered whole grain buns. I wished they could just give us a suggested done ness because i ordered medium well it was too dry but still red inside
Two Blur Guys,"Popped in on a whim because the watery we wanted to go to was full. Glad we did. Came with the family and burgers are always a win with the sons. The fries were crispy and fluffy - most excellent. The burgers were not overly large and very tasty. The only downside was that the buns were very sticky. It felt uncomfortable eating with hands so that eventually we finished up the burgers with fork and knives. While waiting there were table games like Jenga, which kept the boys entertained. Very family friendly. Would come back again, and with the rest of the family next time."
Ashes Burnit,Finally managed to try this joint. Verdict: Absolutely delicious burger at affordable price. The bun was really soft and the coleslaw was tangy and crunchy. Fries were perfect too. The combo below under $10. Fed the family the same next day and they were delighted. Great job guys! Will come back for more next.
Ashes Burnit,Fairly priced burger. Bun was soft. Meat was juicy. Bacon portion was generous. Meal was decent for it's size. Fries was slightly too salty. Didn't have to wait long even when there was a long list of orders before us. Would come again to try something else. Would recommend.
Ashes Burnit,"Tried the Mushroom, fried chicken, grilled chicken. Really worth the money! Taste was good but felt the mushroom burger was a tad oily! Will go try the Mac and Cheese one day soon."
Ashes Burnit,"Started out as an affordable but delicious burger place at $5.90.  Now with inflation, it cost $7.90 for a single patty.  Fries was a huge dissappointment.  It was lukewarm and hard.  Previously there was some seasoning, now is just plain fries with salt that taste bland."
Ashes Burnit,Fried Mushroom Burger: 8/10. Nice amount of truffle flavour in the aioli. The fries have a food crunch too.
Ashes Burnit,"Friendly crew, with burgers at wallet friendly prices. Had a single patty cheeseburger. Patty was juicy and tender, had the light burger bun instead of charcoal bun. Tasty, though portion not large, excellent for those who don't want to feel stuffed and reserve space for lots of other tasty fare. Fries were somewhat thick cut, still crispy immediately after serving although fries may not survive well as a takeaway."
Ashes Burnit,"Does good burgers with juicy beef patties cooked to order, fries are always fresh and crisp. Mac and cheese is good too."
Ashes Burnit,"Their meals always deliver! Recommended their burger to my friend for the first time, and he’s now an official fan!  Tried their truffle mushroom beef burger, meat is nicely seasoned , truffle not too overwhelming and tender enough. Each bite was super juicy and packed with the truffle & mushroom flavour. The chunky fries were super crunchy on outside, hot and soft on the inside.  Ordered an extra dirty fries, very generous serving and packed with ingredients. Very flavourful.  Tried the chicken wings, pretty good for the korean wings style, though not a huge fan of it entirely  Would be a much better experience if they have more options for their condiments besides just chili and ketchup. Fries would go so well with sour cream sauce! :drooling_face:  Overall, very satisfying meal. Will definitely treat myself to their burgers again soon. :grimacing_face:  Definitely recommended lunch option if you visit the hawker centre at Alexandra Village"
Ashes Burnit,Previously tried their burger It good This time round tried their truffle chicken chop Damn nice too
Ashes Burnit,"Ordered a single cheeseburger with fries (not takeaway). Fries were crispy. Beef patty was soft but lacked juice and taste. No idea how it was grilled. The freshly served burger was not hot, and the patty did not look rare."
Ashes Burnit,"Been seeing the review but yet to be able to drop by and test. We couldn't avoid comparing their burgers vs burgs so we ordered crispy mushroom and pulled beef and ribs.  Their burger is bigger than burgs. Their fries is coated fries like kfc , and thicker cuts. Mushroom was good but their pulled beef is better than burgs.  Service was prompt and friendly. Order was ready within 5min of waiting.  The only drawback is that they are located in a small,  packed kopitiam which could be difficult to secure a table."
Ashes Burnit,"Being one of only a handful of halal gourmet burger joints, as well as the owner being an ex- co-founder of Burgs by Project Warung, comparisons would be inevitable.  I think the Smoky Pulled Brisket burger is slightly juicier & succulent as compared to Burgs’ Pulled Beef burger. The beef strands feels a bit more charred also. The charcoal bun is soft and fluffy, which I personally prefer a more toasted/firmer grilled bun. On the overall, it’s a pretty good burger.  The beef patty on the Ashes Smash Cheeseburger also seems tastier than Burg’s Classic Cheeseburger.  The straight cut fries are crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  Well done Ashes Burnnit crew!"
Ashes Burnit,"Above average for a kopitiam western food. Ordered it's truffle chicken chop, serving is more than average too. Worth to try. Worth to return."
Ashes Burnit,Good burger at the price point. Fresher and as nice as macs so its worth it. Patty too thin so its better to get double patty
Ashes Burnit,"Wasn't expecting to have such delicious restaurant-quality burgers in a sleepy coffee shop. The patty is juicy and tender, buns soft and fluffy, with just the right amt of sauce to complement but not overpower the burger. Paired with a generous serving of delicious crispy fries on the side.  Better than shake shack. Highly recommended."
Wildfire Burger,"Had double patty classic cheeseburger! It was very nice, great bun, patty, cheese and onions. Chicken was well marinated too but will definitely be back for the burgers :)"
Wildfire Burger,"The picture of the triple bacon burger was very different to reality. We were told that our fries were separate to the burger,  never heard that before! We got them eventually. The fried chicken was very crispy and delicious."
Wildfire Burger,"I like their really wide selection of beer and the one I ordered a Sg brew Blk622 Dark ALE is to my liking. The cheese burger is above ave, I only wish they could hv asked me whether I prefer med Rare. The bun is soft and overall is not bad. The fried chic is disappointing as it is v bland and I end up ask for chili sauce to go with it.  The service is ok but they don't provide utensils or at least I was not being offer nor disposable glove. The fried chic is oily and there isn't washroom in this place so hv to live with sticky fingers (table napkins is avail thou) :zany_face:"
Wildfire Burger,"Had wanted to come here for a long time and even gave up one time due to its long queue. So was surprised at the  almost empty crowd today on a supposedly busy Sunday afternoon. Guess its significant price hike(comparing w the prices found on GM) plays a part.  Prices aside, their patty is probably the best I had in a long while - juicy and thick enough that trying a double burger would be a bad idea. Their bacon was diced rather than strip, I thought it was a good idea since I often pulled out the whole strip at first bite but the over crispiness and the uneven spread of the bacon bits here affected the texture of the burger, some bites felt like I am eating the burger with some crackers. But the pleasure I had from the patty does makes me still wanna come back to try their other types of burger."
Wildfire Burger,"Got the four cheese burger. The cheese was good and so was the patty but they felt like two distinct flavours plastered on each other. With a slight tweak, the flavour could be improved a lot. Had the chicken drumsticks too- nice crust but it needs to be marinated more.. beyond the skin, the chicken was tasteless."
Wildfire Burger,Lovely dinner at Wildfire. Had the uni burger with ebi patty and squid ink paste and it was very good. Also ordered truffle fries and some nuggets. Service was amazing with this patient lady whose service is top class.
Wildfire Burger,"I was in the area and looking for my work lunch. I found this highly google rated burger store and decided to give it a try.  I was welcomed by a bubbly service staff, invited for me indoor seating, it’s a cooling rain after a downpour and decided to settle with their outdoor seatings.  I order a single patty classic cheeseburger.  Add on $4 for fries plus a cup of Wnglish Breakfast tea. The order came within 8-10 min.  One chomp on the burger and it’s one of the best I had so far locally. At $13 it’s a value for money lunch deal. Look at the images posted. Kudos to the owner.  And by the way I want to comment about their service. The other service staff served a huge jar of iced water. Thanks for the generosity and great hospitality. Thank you and I will return with a bigger group the next time."
Wildfire Burger,"We ordered Classic double and The bear, they are really the best burgers we’ve had in Singapore! Also surprised that Truffle Fries, Strawberry milkshake, and Salad, everything we ordered is so good. Definitely will visit again."
Wildfire Burger,The burgers are pretty good. A single is plenty satisfying. Tried onion and the mushroom. Mushroom is first choice for me. But whenever I bite into the fried chicken I regret I didn't leave more room. Good beers at 11 or 12 bucks. The staff are great and and the music just familiar rock!
Wildfire Burger,What a nice Burger. Reservation was smooth and easy via website. No reservation deposit. All in all one of the best burgers I've had so far. Thanks  :-) Price was fair so far. Maybe you can add one of the popular beer brands to the menue.
25 Degrees Burgers,"This place is one of the best place in Singapore to get your legit American Burger cravings. It is one of the closest you can get.  There was a time where their burger were so good before and then their quality dropped. Recently, we visited again and they improved again.  Their burger patty is so juicy, fatty, and cooked according to our preference. Their buns were soft. Sauce was flavourful and bring the burger all together. A burger wouldn't be complete with the sides and our favourite is the fries and their onion rings. The fries are so crispy and with a creamy potato flavour. The white onion was cut nicely. It was a legit white onion in there unlike other restaurants. Their side portions are huuuge.  Lastly, a milkshake is a must. Tho I find them too sweet as usual but their version is not so bad.  The restaurant is very small so peak hours is quite packed. Better if they got bigger space for dining. Staff are also nice but a bit difficult to get their attention when you need something, one factor is also because of their restaurant layout."
25 Degrees Burgers,"Great value for money. Juicy patties in burgers, though the medium well is still quite pink and rare. Had the Number One which is quite a classic burger  and Number Three- jalapeno provided a good kick. Kids burger is a fantastic size. Sides come in huge portions. Happy hour has 1 for 1 offers for certain items."
25 Degrees Burgers,Great beef burgers with medium rare doneness on its patty but big letdown on the buttermilk chicken burger which was dry and mediocre in taste.  Sides was delicious and satisfying! It’s better to stick to beef burgers.  Good ambience for the burger date or fairly quiet place to chat.
25 Degrees Burgers,"Love the food here. Especially the dirty fries,the combination of bacon gravy and caramelized onions is awesome with the fries and cheese. Had the buttermilk chicken burger,taste uniquely outstanding from the usual buttermilk chickens,had a spice kick to it. Love the milkshake, definitely recommended"
25 Degrees Burgers,Really tasty burgers! Unfortunately the patty was quite overcooked. I loved how the unique sauces and ingredients blend and complement each other.  Service was okay…  Great sides and milkshakes! Love the old school crockery too!
Meatsmith,"Cheeseburger consisted of two thick, juicy, well-charred patties, melted cheese, and pickles to cut through all that oiliness. One of the best burgers I've ever had in my entire existence on planet earth. Fries maintained its crispness well.  Now, coming to the platter for 2, I'd say the brisket and the other meats were done decently well. My only gripe is that the lean parts of 2/4 of the brisket pieces were dry and slightly tough, whereas the other 2 were incredibly fatty and tender. It makes me think if it was from the same cut. The pork ribs and wings were okay, spring rolls were nice, and the other 2 types of meat were well seasoned and fatty. They serve pickles on the side to help cut through all the fat as it might become quite jelak after a few bites. Cornbread served on the side was very dry and hard. Hard pass on that.  The best thing there would have to be the cheeseburger. Platter is slightly pricey but when in Singapore... Anyhow, I'd still come back just for the burger and perhaps try other things on the menu as I'm keen on exploring the other meats they offer!"
Meatsmith,Tried their food at last and it was one of the good decisions I've made. I got the platter for one so that I get to try their different selections. Also got a coffee-base alcohol (Coffee Break) while waiting. It was a fantastic experience. Everything was perfect. All meat were tender and flavorful.  The pork belly was one of the best pork belly I've had. The brisket was also to die for. The sausage was so flavorful so as the wing's flavor. The corn bread smothered with honey but not too sweet. It might not be daily thing for me as the price is on the pricier side but an experience worth trying. Will definitely come again when I can.
Meatsmith,"First time dining at this place. Food portion was huge and very filling. Definitely a place for meat-lover. The pork rib was so tender soft, juicy that it just fell off the bone easily.  The beef short ribs was also tender and juicy. Cooked perfectly  Staffs at the premise was friendly, attentive and informative on what is the best accordingly to the customers needs . Keep it up with the good work :thumbs_up::thumbs_up:"
Meatsmith,"It was unfortunate that we booked on a day that the temple nearby had an event and the jam to the restaurant was terrible. We arrived 15 mins late due to the jam at 7.15pm and was told my the server (wear specs, with beard and plump build guy) that we will have to leave by 8.30pm. We fully understand the need for the restaurant for their turnover, however when we asked if we are unable to finish by then, can we be moved to maybe an outside table, server said no and insisted we have to leave by 8.30pm. He was rather rude and was not very courteous when he said this. But as we already pre ordered the ribeye, we stayed on. Food first arrived at 7.45pm. And at 8.20pm, we wanted to order more food but was hesitant as we have to leave by 8.30pm. But at 8.30pm, there were at least 4 to 5 tables empty with no signs of people coming. And the same server who told us to leave by 8.30pm, asks us if we want to order more drinks. What???! Anyway we settled the bill and left as we would rather go elsewhere to have our drinks and desserts after the unpleasant welcome we received. First time here and service was a let down. However food was great for us. So the food was the saving grace. Venue was not conducive as the next table was loud and rowdy. May reconsider to re visit this restaurant."
Meatsmith,"Ordered cheeseburger, fries, Mac N cheese, and wagyu sizzlers. The beef here is really deep in flavour and juicy. Would prefer the cheeseburger over the sizzler just because the buns goes well with the patty as it absorbs the juice like a sponge which makes it flavourful too. The fries and Mac N cheese has paprika powder, which is always a good thing as it elevates it. Staff is friendly and helpful to give advise on what is good on the menu. Be sure to reserve a table in advance."
Meatsmith,"Came here on a Friday evening to celebrate a birthday. The service staffs are really attentive and we were offered a conducive favorable spot. Just that the food takes a long time to arrive.  We got all three of their platter options. Their meat and chicken were well seasoned, succulent and juicy, and the pork belly simply melts in your mouth. The crab meat and tobiko in the briyani that comes with the dish give an extra dimension of flavor and texture. The lamb, on the other hand, was a little gamey.  The cost is definitely on the higher end. We spent around S$100 each person."
Meatsmith,"Friday evening. We were seated on the second floor, air-con and quiet environment. This is during Singapore restaurant week and we ordered the curated 4-course dinner set each.  Starters: Masala Paneer, Pimento Chutney & Lamb Kofta , Mint Raita  Both dishes are great. The paneer was the right amount of firmness when paired with the sweet chutney was delightful.  Was surprised that I liked the lamb kofta. It was not tough or gamey, seasoned well to have it individually and the sauce complements and gave it another dimension. The pickle added some texture to the dish as well.  Appetiser: Argentinean Red Prawn (Grilled Red Prawn| Corn & Pimento Relish | Lime Aioli)  Nicely presented, great dish with a combination of textures from the prawn, corn and some tanginess from the lime aioli.  Mains: Beef Hanger Steak (Wood fired grilled steak |Madras Butter |Turmeric Citrus Salad |Chickpea Relish)  Ordered medium rare, came as such. The surface was grilled about right and had a good lightly charred and was seasoned well (salt?). The steak was lightly dressed with chickpea relish that was delish. Then the sides… a non assuming salad. NO! The tumeric citrus sauce was refreshing and the greens were fresh and crunchy. The salad kept the dish light.  Dessert: Burnt caramel banana tart with chocolate ice cream (didn’t catch the actual name oops)  Well balanced. From tart to filling ratio, the firmness of the filling, the sweetness of the filling. The team really balanced each aspect well and gave it a really good end to the meal.  Pleasantly surprised by how each sauce and dish are distinctly flavoured and yet still able complement each other and level it up.  The team did a really good job in pairing and curating each dish and overall together for this course meal. Highly recommended, looking forward to the next visit already."
Meatsmith,"I came with a few friends to celebrate a birthday. All I knew about Meatsmith is that they had the same owner as Burnt Ends. Having dined there in the previously, I had my expectations all fired up. The outlet, tucked in an unassuming corner along Campbell Street was surrounded by vegetable wholesalers and textile markets. But what caught our eyes were the pillars painted in blue and white “MEAT” “SMITH”!  Okay, now to the good stuff.  This outlet was placed in Little India for a good reason. They had woven the heritage of Indian cuisine into the dishes, presented with a twist on an Australian Mixed Grill.  The 4 of us decided with the Premium platter for 2. The platter consisted of a starter, appetiser, main and a dessert.  It was truly a culinary masterpiece we had. Such simple dishes, but displayed and presented with tremendous skill and understanding of flavour.  I’ll definitely come back again, when I’m craving for some good Indian fusion!  Swipe for descriptions and pictures of the dishes!"
Meatsmith,"Our only regret was not being hungry enough to order the entire menu! Unlike the South American BBQ Meatsmith at Telok Ayer, Meatsmith Little India has fused Indian flavour with old fashioned BBQ and it works really well. The tandoori stuffed chicken wings, beef short rib vindaloo and masala pork ribs were outstanding. Staff are friendly and very accommodating."
Meatsmith,"Located at the corner of Clive St and Campbell lane, beside Indian Heritage Center and a short walk from Rochor MRT.  Outdoor seating at ground floor and indoor air-conditioning at the 2nd floor. What makes this Meatsmith branch different from the Telok Ayer branch is the Indian inspired dishes. Reservation is a must to avoid disappointments"
Hans Im Gluck,"The place is beautifully decorated with lots of wood; very calming. My son and I each had a burger set meal and it was delicious and much healthier than other burger places. Do note that this is not your super buttery burger like shake shack but I personally like it better. The have a great choice of healthier breads and sides too. There is an entire pamphlet where they list all the allergens in the food they serve; very thoughtful. The service was great and very attentive. I thought that for about $20 burger set meal including a drink (very nice choice of sodas and beers with a small top up), the price was reasonable. Overall, a really great place that I highly recommend."
Hans Im Gluck,"Interesting burgers. Wide selection of healthy dishes. Price wise is a little steep than usual burger shops. But I could say it's worth it. The serving size is large, but even if you finish 1 dish, you won't feel bad because it seems like the burger is made from healthy ingredients.  Vegetarian option available. Staff were all attentive. Cashless. Foods are served by robots. But human service is also available.  Interior is good. Interesting. Chairs are a little uncomfortable, though. Nice to try. Burgers with less guilt. :face_savoring_food:"
Hans Im Gluck,"Food is good overall. I’ve had better beef burgers though; patty felt a little dry, thin, without a crust on the meat patty for me. I actually quite liked the veggie burger they do much more - it has a super nice crispy crust on the bean patty.  20$ for a combo isn’t a bad price so I’ll prob come back."
Hans Im Gluck,"This place has got lot varieties of burgers to try - Meat, chicken, veg and vegan. Ambience of the place is pleasant and so is the staff, very friendly and accommodating.  We ordered Hornträger which is veg burger made of walnut patty with feta cheese and fig jam. Never enjoyed such a burger ever tasting so good. Another burger we tried was Sommerglück which had grilled chicken breast with red pepper sauce and grilled vegetables. Chicken felt bit chewy, but overall was just okie. We enjoyed the platter consisting of sweet potato fries, chicken wings. They were of good quantity. Drink wise, we were pleased with German beer and their cocktails (berry one)"
Hans Im Gluck,"The service is not bad as they would ask how you are, if the food has arrived, seat you quickly etc. The food was good and prices are quite reasonable. However, the website or interface for ordering food was hard to use and took a long time to make our order.  The rustic ambience was not in keeping with the high tech robots who served the food."
Hans Im Gluck,Food was great here. Would recommend more people coming here !
Five Guys,"Had a work lunch here on Tuesday 21st March 2023.  It was surprisingly not packed which is a plus in my books.  Ordered fries, the bacon cheeseburger and a milkshake. The ordering is quite different in that you order the burger and choose from 15 free toppings on the menu. Also, the cheeseburger is double patty from the get go so it’s a large portion at $17. The toppings just make it even bigger. I like it. It’s delicious.  The fries are also well done. It’s a cross between fries and wedges so the texture is awesome. Well fried and not oily.  The real star is the milkshake $11. It’s pricey but oh so delicious and thick and milky. It’s like drinking ice cream but better.  It’s a nice burger joint, pricey in that a meal would set you back $40 per person if you get a milkshake, fries and burger together. But prepare to be stuffed if you do.  Recommended for sure."
Five Guys,"March 2023 • Decent burgers. • Less crowded than McDonald's. • Good place to chill. • Have different sizes, but I couldn't tell the difference; ie, the large and small were almost the same (?) :thinking_face:"
Five Guys,"Five guys is my go to whenever I want a fuss free burger to just stuff my face.  Why? Only because you can stack add ons. Not because it taste great, or has a nicely toasted bun, or special homemade sauce. No. Only for sheer gluttony without care for anything else.  It's burger patties are tasteless when eaten together with everything, and i imagine they are tasteless on their own as well.  Their burgers are priced in the 'okay' region, but the fries are exorbitant maybe because they know its nicer than their burgers.. In any case to get a burger and fries = expensive.  So definitely not a must try place, and you won't be sorry even if you skipped it.  @goodfoodwrite - instagram & YouTube"
Five Guys,"It’s almost impossible to get good gluten free options but this place is my dependable go to. Juicy, fresh burgers with superb yummy toppings !!!! Wish I found out about them sooner mmmm"
Five Guys,"2 keywords to describe the food here. Expensive and salty. We ordered 4 burgers, 1 large fries, 3 drinks... and it cost us almost 100 dollars. For food that was served in fast food style, and not on a tray but inside a big paper bag, it felt way overpriced for what we are getting. The burgers are above average to be fair, but we all felt that they tend to be too salty for our taste. In short, unless the prices drop to a more reasonable level, there is no reason to eat here."
Five Guys,"Food was delicious and artery-clogging, which is exactly what you’d expect from Five guys. Both my friend and I ordered the double cheeseburger, with our own assortment of toppings.  Service was great as your food goes from order to table within 8 minutes, even on a busy day.  This outlet had a lively atmosphere, both on the inside and outside (it has outdoor seating).  Overall it was up to standard and you can’t really ask for more."
Five Guys,"Very delicious! Two people orders two burgers with regular fries and a milkshake is just nice！ total is around 50 SGD.  Bacon is very crispy and yummy!  Fries I prefer Cajun flavor:) original is classic one, cajun is more flavorful  Milkshake u can all all mix-ins, I usually add Oreo, chocolate, and lotus  Highly recommend!"
Five Guys,"Best burger in town! If you are looking for a food that will cheer you up when you feel down then this is the place to be.  Whenever we come and visit. Me and my husband always eat the same, which are cheese burger, fries and milkshake (please try choco banana, it's the bomb!). The burger is well complimented by the fries and the shake's sweetness does magic to balance out the saltiness of it.  So come and drop by and try their food!"
Five Guys,"Big big burger with big big price tag! The bacon cheese burger is tasty, and so filling... love the pickles. Little fries are already quite big, and the milkshake is sweet. Probably not something one eats regularly, only on special occasions when one forgets the pain of extreme bloating! :P  Nice outdoor space to chill and eat.. watching the world go by. Some occasional questionable noisy music tracks playing, but generally a good ambiance.  P/S: I was here for my dad's 77th birthday treat."
Five Guys,1 of the best fast food burgers I really like. Very thick and juicy beef Patties. Got too much fries and couldn’t finish them. Very large and filling portions! Would love to visit again and again!
Five Guys,"Excellent cheeseburger. Added additional patty for $2.50. When eaten fresh at store, patty was juicy and the cheese complimented the patties so well. Got the large fries $13.50 and it was impossible to finish among 2 guys because they fill the cup till it overflows into the bag. much better than shake shack burgers imo although really greasy"
Five Guys,"I just visited  Five Guys and was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food and service. The burgers were juicy and flavorful, with a perfectly toasted bun that held everything together nicely. The fries were crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside, and seasoned just right.  The atmosphere of the restaurant was comfortable with chill music background. The space were also really spacious with US standard. The only downside was that the prices were a bit on the high side, but I would say the quality of the food and service makes up for it.  Overall, I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a delicious meal and a great dining experience. I give it 4 stars!"
Five Guys,"My first time here and it didn't disappoint! I ordered bacon cheeseburger + all toppings. Its was so flavorful, the beef patty was so juicy omg! The burger was big enough and the fries completes the meal. I also ordered their salted caramel milkshake which I think was the best J had in Singapore. Total price was about $40 but I stayed there for an hour as well. Atmosphere was cosy and the service was really quick. Definitely a must try! :OK_hand_medium-light_skin_tone:"
Five Guys,"Ordered bacon cheeseburgers with all toppings and steak sauce / BBQ sauce. BBQ sauce suits this burger more.  Overall the burger was pretty decadent and satisfies any cheeseburger cravings you might have.  Service staff forgot to add bacon into our bacon cheeseburgers, so they actually gave us whole bacon slices in an aluminum tray."
Five Guys,"I love their french fries! They tasted really good and they said that their fries on that day were imported from The Netherlands. Their Chocolate Milkshake was also really thick, heavy, and you can definitely taste the chocolate :grinning_face_with_sweat:"
Shake Shack,"Good quality burger. Very busy to dine in. Need to wait for other people to finish meal. But it was very quick. I tried to classic shack burger. Bun is very soft, vegies also fresh, patty is good. Would recommend"
Shake Shack,"YUM YUM YUMS!!!! Everything I expected out of a good burger. Shack burger is delicious as always. Bread is so soft, beef is so juicy and tasty, cheese and sauce was abundant and YUMMZYYYY. :hamburger::face_savoring_food: Makes all the calories worth it!!!! :smiling_face_with_hearts: Iced tea is without sugar and also very tasty!  Tons of seats available indoors and out. The counter staff was courteous and helpful during the order taking process. RECOMMEND :hundred_points: for the good vibes and food!! :kissing_face_with_closed_eyes::yellow_heart::glowing_star:"
Shake Shack,"Good food, but always a bit dirty. Flies/dirt in the trash area and tables not very clean. As much as i love the food, the hygiene in the restaurant makes me wonder if it's also not clean in the kitchen. I come for the antibiotics free chicken nuggets."
Shake Shack,Grub :hamburger: :hamburger: :hamburger: :hamburger: Dricka :beer_mug: :beer_mug: :beer_mug: :beer_mug: Price :kitchen_knife: Vibes :red_paper_lantern: :red_paper_lantern: :red_paper_lantern: Service :person_bowing: :person_bowing: :person_bowing: :person_bowing: Parking :P_button: :P_button: :P_button: :P_button: Overall :trophy: :trophy: :trophy: :trophy:  Surprisingly good biru from SS. Go for the spicy :hamburger: one. Cheese fries :french_fries: a must! This joint gives you vibe of Orchard Road - right in the action.
Shake Shack,"It was my first but definitely not the last time at Shack Shack. Shack Stack cheeseburger tasted fantastic. Even if the portion doesn't look that big, in the end, I was struggling to finish it. Ohh and the lemonade... fantastic :clapping_hands_light_skin_tone:"
Shake Shack,"Came here for supper. Tried a few times in the UK so had to try it here when the hype died down. The person accepting my order didn't have good command of English but that didn't bother me. I was happy to point what I want on the menu. I read the reviews about how bad the communication skills might be but it didn't deter my experience. If it puts food in their bellies and give them an honest wage why take that away from them. Everyone deserves a chance no matter how articulate you are no matter what qualifications you have. My reviews are purely on food alone. I like that there's different types of sauces available. The double smoke burger I got was nice but wasn't the greatest at that price point. The spicy chicken burger wasn't the best it was kinda dry and the spice kinda took everything away for me. Not much to process. Fries was okay, pretty average but hot."
Shake Shack,"Let’s start with service. Staff was abrupt when taking order. I do not like to say this, they need to improve on their command of English as well. I now appreciate those ordering kiosks at the Shake Shack @ Stanford Shopping Mall, Palo Alto. I did not have to deal with attitude as well.  I love Shake Shack and it is my comfort food and need a SS burger fix once every few weeks when I was in America. The shack sauce here did not taste like how it should be back in America. The burger patty was overall way too salty. I hope they would improve on the food and the service. Until then, I am hesitant to return."
Shake Shack,"Had their ShackBurger and Shackmeister ale. Found the burger a tad greasy but it wasn’t unbearable, just not what I expected from a burger. The beer was great, refreshing especially in our weather. Funnily though, it’s more worth it to get the smaller pint than the bigger one when it’s usually the other way around.  One more thing, if you order a beer via the self-service kiosk, you’ll be told that someone will come around to assist you but no one did so I would suggest to go straight to the counter if you’re ordering beer."
Shake Shack,Good place for a quick bite and a great beer on tap!  If you step by the terminal to order food and beer - it will show you a msg that you will get someone to help since you are ordering beers … unfortunately no one turns up hence need to go to the counter to order everything all over again! I see this is a stretch area you can improvise on ..
Shake Shack,"It's the same as the rest of the Shake Shacks around. If you choose the seats near the entrance of Suntec, you might get to see nice cars / supercars if that's your thing.  Otherwise, food and drinks quality are on par, but they need to clean the tables more often. Even if the previous patrons clear their trays, there'll still be drips and sauces on the table."
Shake Shack,"I really wanted to try this burger, and finally tried it in Singapore.  the place is very instagrammable, the service is quite fast, the price is a little expensive compared to other burger brands.  but the taste of the burger is very good, the meat is thick juicy, the bun is soft.  The cheese potato is also delicious but you have to share it because the portion is big.  the shakes are delicious too.  the total meal I paid was around S$25"
Shake Shack,"First time trying this and asking the staff for the most recommended one. The beef petty was so juicy and yet tender, the bun also taste good, not like a plain bread. Also try their famous fries with cheese sauce. Their sauce is soooo good even though i buy it for take home, but still delicious. Anyway if you want to eat there also very recommended, cause their store have a nice ambience and ample space to sit."
Shake Shack,"I was at first a bit puzzled by the prices which seemed to be a bit expensive for simple burgers. However here’s the difference, they are not just simple burgers ! Pleasant surprise by the quality and taste of the food. I had the pleasure to try this fantastic mushroom burger, juicy and with this delicious cheese. Portions seem to be a bit small but fair enough to make your life happier. As a healthy person, I ordered a bottle of water as a drink and look at this fancy and gorgeous bottle design ! Shape of the fries are also very interesting. Highly recommend. Staff there is really nice and helpful !"
Shake Shack,"The store here has the most different vibe from other outlets. The store is quite spacious & the decor is different from other stores.  The seating is only indoor, there are quite a lot of tables with various capacities, from 2 people to large capacity.  After ordering & paying, they will give you a beeper to show when your order is ready.  My order: * Pandan Shakes You can really taste the pandan flavour, to the point that the bitter taste of the leaves is there, you can taste the coconut flavor too. Topped with shredded coconut & chopped brown sugar.  Service is quite fast like fast food in general. The staff is moderately friendly."
Shake Shack,"It might not be known for its ice cream—just classic flavours vanilla and chocolate after all—but that’s the thing: Shake Shack’s ice cream is a best-kept secret. For just $4.80 a single scoop, you get a BIG humdinger of a single scoop! It’s almost the equivalent of two scoops at other ice cream places. And it checks all the right boxes: rich flavour, density, and perfect for sharing."
Shake Shack,"I always wanted to try their burger, but nvr had a chance until today. Their burger is fresh and juicy. I tried their Stack Shack, which is their signature, and it is mixed of beef and mushroom. It is really yummy!!! After main course, go for their desserts, “concretes”. Both the berries and chocolate flavors are good too! Berries goes with cheesecake and the chocolate goes with brownies, perfect combo! Will go again."
Shake Shack,"First time here. Highly recommended by a friend. To my surprise, the burgers were really good. My favorite was the mushroom burger. Gooey cheese on portobello mushroom. How can I say no to this combination:). I liked how the chicken popcorns were actual chicken meat pieces hence my kids gave two thumbs up for approval."
Shake Shack,"A spacious burger place that produces burgers that taste great! The price of the burger is a bit on the pricey side, but I guess if you want to experience gourmet burger, this will be a good place to start. Will return to taste the other burgers and offerings that Shake Shack is known for."
Shake Shack,Seems the least popular of the many outlets. Easy to get seats everytime I come. Makes sense as the quality of the product and service remains the same as other branches.
Shake Shack,"The food is the same as every other Shake Shack. It’s also a large venue with ample seating. A few general comments on the food. I find Shake Shack is something that I get a craving for now and again. I like the Martin’s potato roll buns they use because I grew up with them and they’re tasty. I like the fresh lettuce and tomato on the burgers, though the find the burgers on the salty side (hint: you can order them with no salt on the patty) and the umami can be a little overwhelming. Their fries were always mediocre. I like the addition of the chicken nuggets but the breading is a bit heavy and tends to fall off easily. Finally, I’d say avoid their specials. They’re rarely, if ever, better than the regular menu items. That said, I like the current avocado specials. When choosing seating if dining it, I recommend avoiding the booths next to the giant screen. It’s super bright and will irritate your eyes. Fortunately, it’s a large space with plenty of options."
Shake Shack,"Upscale fast food...first time trying this spot and pleasantly surprised at how good it was.  Chicken sandwich was flavorful and cooked just right.  Enjoyed some fries which is something I rarely order, but on a hot day, why not.  A few bites of a mango dessert sealed the deal.  For a quick bite, I'd recommend eating here.  Can't beat the location...right by the Cloud Forest in Gardens by the Bay."
Shake Shack,"Delicious and satisfying burgers! It tastes really good for me, the harmony of the ingredients is simply right, especially the cheese burger one. Every bite is a meatful, flavorful, and satisfying bite.  Not to mentions their other nice side dishes like cheese fries and chicken bites, my kids love it.  It's packed when I came there, because of the strategic location, just in front on the Cloud Forest Dome. Fortunately we secured one nice spot for our family and had a nice lunch there."
Shake Shack,"Very busy and hard to get a seat once you do everyone is staring at you because everyone is waiting for people to leave to get a seat. The food is nice but nothing special. But if your at the gardens then this is a perfect place to stop, eat and cool down. The salted caramel milkshake is nice."
Shake Shack,"Newly opened. Burgers are great and juicy, vanilla malted shake is way too sweet for my liking. Staffs were friendly, accommodating and complied with the safe distancing rules."
Shake Shack,"One of the best burgers I have had in Singapore!!! The self order system is easy to use for local and foreigners. The service is really fast and efficient.  There were many varieties of food and drinks. Most importantly, the burgers were very delicious, fresh and easy to eat. The price of a burger is very affordable compared to other burgers joints in Singapore.  Overall, will always stop by Shakeshack when in Singapore :Singapore:"
Shake Shack,"Fries was well done. 1st time tasting their nuggets (chicken bites). Small but nice and tender. Pink lemonade is great too. Sweet and sour mixed. On their new BBQ Meister burger, it's just the additional BBQ bits with the rest being similar to the Shack burger. Given the difference in cost, maybe stick with original. That's me after trying both so depends on individuals:) enjoy - 2 shake shack in a weekend. No more burgers review for a while."
Shake Shack,"Went for Saturday lunch 1ish pm.. The food is really nice but very slow.  This is supposed to be fast food but it felt like waiting for food in a restaurant  , the wait was even longer. Due to the long wait I didn't have time to run my errands. There were a reasonable number of staff , the wait was unjustified. The burgers were very yummy and looked quality."
Shake Shack,"Very happy that Shake Shack took over the standalone restaurant space at Junction 8. My family loves the burgers, fries and milk shakes! The 1st floor looks cosy, but the 2nd floor is much nicer! Have to go up to experience the nice seating environment, complete with a handwashing station!"
Shake Shack,"Tried the porttebello burger. The taste is one of the best I have ever tasted. However, the food is very overpriced, especially the price is for burgers only, no side dishes. Not going to try again unless with special reason."
Shake Shack,"Jan 2023: Had the shack burger, dark meat hot chicken, cheese fries, and black & white classic shake. Everything is fine, the chicken tasted a bit like McSpicy. Damage was $30+, which is quite high for a fast food meal. Will be good if the stall revises down the prices to account for the portion size."
Shake Shack,"Love this Shake Shack branch as it overlooks out to the waters and has an open-air area to dine that's actually very cool temperature wise in the evenings.  Singapore's sambal mayo is a good addition to the menu, adding that local uniqueness of flavour to the burger options. Shake Shack's beef patties are just oh-so-yummy! I always make it a point to order a double patty so as to indulge!"
Shake Shack,"Ordered double patties nice n juicy. Everything in ala carte. It a little pricey for a burger. They have a innovative automated hand washer (3 in 1 soap, rinse, paper towel)"
Shake Shack,"Was in a rush hence ordered takeout. Although it was lunch time but there was no crowd hence expected fast food preparation. After waiting more than 10 mins, checked with the counter. Stood there for around 2 mins but they were busy. A lady came and requested her to check my order. She packed the items and it was ready in less than 1 min. Meaning the order was ready but nobody cared to pack it. Munched on the burger shortly after driving off and it was only lukewarm meaning the food was ready long ago. Burger was good but shake is very small portion. Service could have been better. Don't look unhappy when asked to check something. Should work with some enthusiasm"
Shake Shack,"Good burgers, clean taste. Docked a star because of the long waiting time (~20 mins on a weekday night), and because the tables weren’t so clean. Throughout our 1.5 hours there was no attempt to clean the place - says more about understaffing than the quality of the staff, I think."
Shake Shack,"The foods great. Only odd thing is when they forgot to put bacon onto one of our burgers, they took the burger and sprinkled the bacon on the side where we passed it to them, so the bacon wasn't even centered (sure we did it ourselves, but the staff didn't seem apologetic at all, they made it seem like it was our fault which is quite bad behaviour). I hope other customers don't go through the same treatment we faced."
Shake Shack,"Finally tried this famous Burger chains, but was totally disappointed. We would expect a decent burger with that price, but the Chicken burger is just way too salty. Fried Chicken Patty is also dark/black in colour as in the frying oil has been reused multiple times. The colour reminds me of street fried food, this shouldn't be happening as it's not acceptable. Dear Management, please train your employees to change the oil from time to time. Thank you."
Shake Shack,"Burger Bliss Unleashed! :hamburger::french_fries:  A symphony of flavors awaits at ShakeShack where the juicy patty dances in harmony with the softest bun, while the perfectly cooked fries add a crispy delight.  With an array of mouthwatering Heinz sauces to choose from, this place is a true haven for burger enthusiasts. Prepare to indulge in a taste sensation like never before!  SmokeShack: 9.25 /10 ChickenShack: 8.5 /10 Fries: 8.25 /10 Fifty/Fifty: 7 /10"
Shake Shack,"Coming from Australia, Shake Shack beats all the fast foods we have available in our country! We got the classics and we enjoyed it! Small details were appreciated too. They gave us mustard on the side!"
Shake Shack,"We landed just after lunch hour and it is better to refuel before taking a hectic day ahead.  We just order some burgers and two drink, my coconut pandan taste so yummy and refreshing, my burger also taste good.  The place is always crowded but staffs is really working hard to make the place clean"
Shake Shack,"Fresh burgers and fries but the taste has deviated. Burger patty has a salty taste but overall lacks any flavor that makes you want to take another bite. The crinkle fries are fresh and crispy but again, it lacks the savoriness found in McDonald’s. In n out is still my favorite."
Shake Shack,I feel that food is over-priced. $50 for a meal with minimal vegetables. Their lemonade+tea is not bad tho. Fries are not bad. Better than McDonald's fries. Ordered a burger that has chilli in it. Patty is quite juicy indeed.
Shake Shack,"Must try famous beef burger and shroom burger. Order single size is fairly enough, double is too much and greasy. Cheese fries need to be consumed asap when it’s hot."
Shake Shack,"2nd time dining here, not too crowded. Always love their burgers esp their mushroom and meat double patties. Also love their cheese fries.  Ordered the limited edition Sakura beer which was tad sweet for my liking."
Shake Shack,"Burger is smaller than the ones in US and Japan. Patties are thin, taste is on the salty side. For all that, it is over priced for this quality, I can settle with McDonald’s which is much cheaper."
Shake Shack,"Great burgers, sinful shakes (which I typically need to avoid, unfortunately). Nice place also to hang out. Pricewise more on the steep side while the burgers are not that big (but fries portion are), but it's shake shack!"
Shake Shack,"I ordered a regular size curly fries cup, truffle flavour. I've patronised shake shake many times from different outlets, and the truffle and barbeque are one of the better flavours. It's a pity the person who gave me the fries this time didn't give enough truffle powder. Hopefully I'll get more powder next time!  There are around four seats at the counter for people to sit. As such, it allows for takeaway and dine in."
Shake Shack,currently showing open but there’s no one at the counter. waited for 10mins and still no one. say no to business isit?
Shake Shack,"Located Just beside a hotdog shop. Infront of the toilet n carpark. Remember to shake it all up, yums! first time dinning in, hot food!"
Shake Shack,Was there ytd and only 2 employees were working. Auntie was easily doing 3 mens worth of job and the dude was struggling to even read the orders. Give auntie a raise man
Shake Shack,Bought the individual bento and was nice but maybe can add more sauce to the rice. Staff's attitude was nice too :)
Shake Shack,Yucks After eating one pc I felt like vomiting!! Soggy!!  Horrible and expensive fries!! Worst fries I have tasted!!  *Don't waste your money!!* You wanna eat fries Go get from Wingstop or McDonald's They are experts with fries!
Shake Shack,"Went to the Tamp Hub outlet this morning and finally tried Shake Shake in a Tub. I took quite a while to decide my order as it is my first time there, but the staff was polite and helpful, she gave me recommendations to the flavours and all. The fries with truffle powder is one of the nicest fries I ever had, it was freshly fried too. The staff recommended me to try it with the sauces as well, so I went with the mala sauce, which has a spicy kick to it. The chicken was also well cooked and well coated with sauce. Would recommend to my friends. Great food and helpful staff"
Shake Shack,"Went to buy a medium fries on 25/06 at around 14:43. Price was 4.70 n while waiting saw there is a promotion from 2-5pm, $5 with a lot of other stuff. Told the cashier wanted to change as my order was not ready. She told me in a not so happy face cannot change once order is placed. I ask her why never told me there is a promotion and she told me the poster is so big why I cannot see. If your store is doing promotion, why your staff is not telling customers ??? The difference is only 30cent. Is it because you need to do more work to prepare? Email to the management n never get a reply Will not buy from them again"
Shake Shack,"Went on a Sunday night and placed an order via Grab for pick up. The food was alright, freshly fried and well seasoned. Busy though so waiting time was approx 30minutes!  5 stars for the staff handling the orders that day - I wanted to change my order flavor, but I found out that she had prepared it already. However the staff still very kindly went ahead with the request to change. She also checked that my bowl of chicken/fries was filled with no gaps. I also saw that she topped up on the seasoning powder to ensure maximum coating. Pity I didn’t have her name; she’s a service staff that would go above and beyond & who takes pride in her work."
Shake Shack,"Staff working alone today and very unethical. She should atleast approach customers who have been there waiting for quite a while that she can only attend to us once she’s done with the earlier orders,  do not leave customers hanging with no update. We don’t mind waiting considering she is short handed, that is why we join the Q in the first place. What turned us off is her behaviour who don’t seem to bother with customers. My family and the other two students who were there longer than us ended up leaving. Please train your staffs to have basic customer service."
Shake Shack,First time here and know about this place. the staff is very friendly too. super love the service here. :)

Skirt and Dirt,"This is a unique Hawker Stall with cooked to order burgers and a delicious cheese ""skirt"". It's a perfect comfort food for a weary traveler or a hangover fix.  The burger was juicy with a good amount of beef and toppings (lettuce, tomato, cheese and sauce).  The cheese is a flat crispy ""skirt"" that hangs far off the bun.   Add fries for $1 ($9 combo). It can get a little greasy but it's worth it.  The fries were hot and crispy with their ""dirt"" dusting.  They have a good ketchup offering if you want more on the fries.  If you're thirsty, grab a drink and support a nearby coffee/drink hawker for $1-$2.  I visited late afternoon after the lunch rush.     Not disappointed."
Skirt and Dirt,"Ordered a trio - and topped it off w good bowl of coleslaw . Like the burgers for staying juicy and coleslaw for not too sweet !  Their dirt fries is comforting - in their pickles, capsicum, bacon and all . Wanted to finish off w a bottle of beer but yea no drink and drive ..  Still a hearty meal and good value of money !"
Skirt and Dirt,"Had their SND (Skirt & Dirt) Hamburger. Decent n well cooked. Ala carte s $6. Reasonable, consider its freshly cooked. I ordered e set that comes with Cajun fries. This s at $7. Added e coleslaw. Total $10. Portion s good. Not over sized like others. Will come back to try their other items on menu."
Skirt and Dirt,"Came here for lunch and had a set meal and burger. Unique and tasty, at a reasonable price, too. Will come back if im at tiong bahru market again. Would reccommend if you like burgers and have not tried them before!"
Skirt and Dirt,"Off peak so my burger was freshly prepared. I even had hot piping mushroom soup. Love d salsa. What I cannot stand is, fries aren't crispy n fish patty isn't crispy too. 1st time I didn't finish my fries. I don't get it. It's only 1 portion yet they cannot b fried thoroughly. 3* coz I like d salsa, otherwise it's a 2*."
Burger Labo,"We finally managed to come here for lunch and got a 2280 burger and a basic burger, with bacon added to the latter, shared a sweet potato fries, and got two iced lemon teas. The burgers indeed look very basic but were quite tasty, and we particularly liked the pickled onions. I’d say the portions could have been slightly bigger, but overall they were good burgers, way better than what you get at most places. The sweet potato fries were okay but far from the best we’ve had. I’d prefer them cut thinner and they may wish to consider offering two portion sizes. The iced lemon tea wasn’t great. It’s definitely homemade but tastes like bitter lemon water. We don’t like our tea sweetened, but all the same, this didn’t quite do it for us. Service was good and the atmosphere was nice. The food also came out promptly. The ordering system presumes familiarity with the menu, so if you’re thinking of going here for the first time, I’d say browse the pictures among the reviews here first. Adding photos or explanations on the terminals would be helpful. All in all, it was a very good burger experience and could become a great one with a few small tweaks. Recommended."
Burger Labo,"Invited my colleagues to have lunch at this cozy burger restaurant on Friday.  Nice ambience with minimal sitting. Quick turnaround and short waiting time for your food. Overall, we love the basic burger (Note: its a beef burger) and Blue Cod Fillet burger (it is pricey but you want to  pay for good food isn’t it). Not to mentioned their savoury truffle fries!  Will come back to this BurgerLabo with my wife for the lobster roll."
Burger Labo,"Holy smokes they make good burgers!  You get more patty than bun which is usually the opposite at other places where you end up being too stuffed on the bread and feel sick after.  Super juicy, too juicy. Prepare to get sauce all over your face and clothes.  Quality beef patties and I think the single patty would be enough for most.  Can't wait to be back!"
Burger Labo,"I am always a burger person. Whenever I notice there is a burger restaurant. I will go and try it out. Visited this place since I was nearby. Ordered their double cheese burger takeaway. Although it doesn't look pleasent when I open it in my office. I would say I loved the meat, cooked medium well and the juice is still in. with their sauce paired with pickled onion, It was good. My opinion is the sauce can be a little bit more flavourful (personally opinion as I liked heavy taste food) just a little bit more salty would be perfect."
Burger Labo,Tried the cod burger and medium rare steak for sharing. Sweet potato fries was nice and generous portion.The coconut cocktail was refreshing and not bad a match with cod burger.
Pizzaface,"I have been wanting to visit this place  after seeing rave reviews and finally I did. First and foremost, the service here is top notch - thanks to the friendly crew that made an enjoyable evening even more enjoyable. If you crave for quality pizza and pasta without burning a hole in your pocket, here is the place to be."
Pizzaface,Best value for money authentic italian pizzas in town. Great flavors and the pizza is light and non greasy. The wings and pasta were delicious too. Efficient and attentive service. Loved the facf that all the food arrived piping hot! Special mention that they don't charge for water unlike many other restaurants. Hands down one of the best fresh pizzas we've had without having to burn a hole in the pocket.
Pizzaface,"Came here for a first time as we were in the vicinity. The service was excellent, coupled with the yummy pizza, cool and relaxing ambience and coffee (which was really great tasting btw.)  One of the staff even gave a cake for my sis’s birthday, which was such a wonderfully sweet gesture.  I would definitely be back to try more flavours."
Pizzaface,Came here on a quiet Saturday afternoon for lunch and was blew away by their pizza and pasta. Had Burrata + and Crab pasta that I forgot the name. The pizza was perfect - from the dough to the burrata. The crab pasta was also really yummy but the pizza really stole the show.  Left really satisfied and happy.
Pizzaface,Pizza was good.. we ordered the Parma ham with fig and the goat cheese with shroom. Toppings were generous. Dough was chewy. But tiramisu was so so. Restaurant is understaffed. There were 2 service personnel but felt like only 1 was working. The lady that attended to us was warm and friendly. It was hard for her to manage so many tables on her own so service may take awhile.
Pizzaface,"Their pizza surprisingly wasn’t the star. This was the Gorgonzola & Spinach Pizza, it was pretty underwhelming (not cheesy enough, the caramelised onions were too sweet). Ironically the really good dish, I didn’t take a photo… but the oven-baked penne with mixed mushroom & truffle cream was the BOMB. So good."
Pizzaface,"We have always been ordering from grab and wanted to come down to try it. The pizza was absolutely amazing! the crust, the taste and the thickness was perfect. carbonara was super cheesy and creamy, just the way it should be.  This place is one hidden gem that serves really good pizza and pasta. We’ll always be back and will continue to order delivery as well. (But it’s definitely way better when you dine in!)"
Pizzaface,Warm service and good food. Do note that the place is quite small and can only fit about 14 pax in total. They have many loyal takeaway customers from the neighborhood.
Pizzaface,Hidden gem in Ulu Pandan area! Nice thin crust with generous fillings. Staff are friendly.
Pizzaface,Awesome service and we absolutely love their truffle pizza! Easily the best in SG! Slices of the pizza flew off before I could snap a pic! Ha!
Chooby Pizza,"Amazing pizza and whitebait! Beers were great as well. Tried the pulled pork pizza. I'm more impressed by the pizza dough than the toppings which says a lot about how good the dough is! Pizza is not oily, good amount of topping. Great for a casual evening!"
Chooby Pizza,"Pretty tough to get a reservation. It opens every Monday and only for three evenings a week. Quite value for money. Dough is chewy, wet and crusty. We enjoyed the truffle mushroom and margarita pizzas. The whitebait was also pretty good (tasted similar to OCK’s fried sotong). Matcha latte from old hen had just the right amount of sweetness and bitterness."
Chooby Pizza,Excellent chewy Neapolitan pizza. We tried the classic pepperoni with thick cut and savory pepperoni. Plus beer battered whitebait. This was surprisingly good. It tasted almost like fried soft shell crab. definitely will be back to try more dishes. Hopefully this place open more reservation in other days. Currently reservation is only can be made on Monday 12pm for the week itself for dining between we-fri evening.
Chooby Pizza,Honestly really great calamaris and pizza! The portions are slightly smaller but still really worth the money as it’s handmade sourdough pizzas. Favourite of the night is the kimchi pizza!
Chooby Pizza,"Yummy pizzas - for me t’s the dough that’s the winner - chewy, soft, and tasty! They make & serve the pizzas a la minute, so the cheese is well melted and stringy, and food comes piping hot. Toppings and combinations are pretty decent.  The menu is limited, but probably all the pizzas are good (we tried 3 and all were good), so that’s ok. Very limited sides though. Small but decent craft beer menu. Pricing is reasonable.  There are some challenges here. You must make a booking with a prepaid deposit. That helps the restaurant space out arrivals and cooking times, but still from the moment of ordering to food arriving at the table it’s 25 - 40 minutes. It seems they purposely stagger your food so your pizzas won’t come all together but one by one instead- but then for all the tables in the restaurant that’s happening m, so I guess the goal is tables aren’t starving. So I guess, order pizzas meant for your party to share rather than pizzas for individual consumption if you can.  I don’t understand why the restaurant doesn’t provide any bread or instantly servable appetisers. If you look around the room, everyone’s crabby and waiting for their food, and a little nibble would go a long way to soothing all the hangry guests. We’d probably even pay for it.  Pro tip: bring your own appetisers. We were seated next to a group that were friends of one of the waitstaff. They had 3 bags of their own pastry as appetisers while waiting. I guess they’d been warned. Also, they got a free ice cream. (That would have been a nice touch for those of us with kids patiently and hungrily waiting for their pizzas.)  Service is not great here, it’s basically self serve. The one waitstaff I did see was only interested in talking to her friends.  Still, pizzas are tasty and reasonably priced, so I might return. Will bring my own appetisers though."
Yellow Cab Pizza,Affordable And Yummy Pizza!  Tastes different from its Philippines counterpart but in a good way.  Pizza toppings seems more premium and cooked fresh.  The mount of pizza and toppings you get is bang for your buck.  Pizza is thin enough to hold the topping while maintaining a soft dough.  Past is also good.  You have to try the four seasons pizza and charlie chan pasta.  Chicken wings are also yummy.  Doesn’t get crowded and has a ton of seats even outdoor ones.  Service is good might need to wait a while for the pizza because its fresh!  One of the better fast casual pizzas in Singapore for sure!
Yellow Cab Pizza,"I came here on a recommendation by a friend. She loved the Philippine’s branch and asked me to try it in Singapore. The restaurant was almost at the end of Esplanade MRT (maps doesn’t show that). It was calm and had good options. I tried Charlie Chan pasta, and god it bombarded with flavours. Perfect spice and great taste. It is also mentioned that BBQ chicken Pizza is great, but I haven’t tried it."
Yellow Cab Pizza,"Good thing is no service charge. Their pizza is just ok. Nothing to be impress. Minimum service. By the way, their cloth wiping table was terrible. Very smelly and I can even smell it after table has been wipe."
Yellow Cab Pizza,Walked in restaurant during Christmas Day. Not crowded during the lunch hour that day. Four season pizza is good. We love the potato skin with cheese and bacon. The pesto pasta a bit too dry for us.
Yellow Cab Pizza,Nice quiet place located at one end of city link. Prices are very reasonable and there is Happy hour for beer lovers.
Peproni Pizzeria,"I recently dined at Peperoni Pizzeria located at United Square with my family and my cousin's family. We ordered a variety of dishes including the XXL half (Burrata & Prosciutto) & Half (Diavola) pizza, Fusilli Chicken & Mushroom Pesto, kids' Hawaiian pizza meals, and Bolognese pasta meal.  Let me start by saying that the food at Peperoni Pizzeria was absolutely delicious. The pizzas were freshly made and cooked in a stone oven, resulting in a perfectly crispy crust and a delightful combination of flavors. The generous toppings on both the XXL half (Burrata & Prosciutto) & Half (Diavola) pizzas were a treat for our taste buds. The pasta dishes, including the Fusilli Chicken & Mushroom Pesto and the Bolognese, were cooked to al dente perfection and packed with flavor. We enjoyed every bite and ended up finishing all the food we ordered.  Despite the delicious food, the service was mediocre due to a lack of attentiveness."
Peproni Pizzeria,"Good food, good service. Specially commend Jacqueline for seating us at a smaller table while waiting for larger table to clear, as we have elderly among us. Was also attentive to elderly needs and actively gave good recommendations when ordering. Food is good, just a little pricey."
Peproni Pizzeria,"Very pleased with the atmosphere and service in this restaurant. The food were all great! We tried both the pizza and pasta, all were great. Looking forward to return to try the rest of the menu!"
Peproni Pizzeria,12 inch with about 2 inch crust for $27++. Ingredients are sparse in-between a paper thin base. Literally NO ONE ordered after us and they could still mess up a pizza this badly. I now know to never come to one of these ever again. Hope this helps you make an informed decision instead of blindly trusting 5 star reviews.
Peproni Pizzeria,"Very friendly and customer oriented staff- especially the nice lady who served me on both occasions. Ordering was easy as I could call in advance before heading down. The pizza was fresh and delicious. Love the personal touch when the lady WhatsApp me when my pizza was ready. Hence, collection was a breeze!"
Peproni Pizzeria,"It is a chain but their expansion is testament to the tasty fare.  We thoroughly enjoyed the burrata prosciutto pizza (M, $22) and bacon amatriciana ($22). Ingredients were plentiful and the tomato base on both was good. The fresh tomatoes on the former, in particular, were juicy and sweet. Crust-wise, what they do is crisp all the way through... a bit too table-water-cracker-ish for my personal preference, but it suits if you are looking for thin-crust."
Peproni Pizzeria,Service was prompt and the crew were pleasantly cheerful and helpful. We ordered using QR code which is great. We were there early for dinner ~ 530 and were surprised to see that many tables were starting to fill up. Must be a testament to the good reviews for this outlet.  We ordered: - Seared Scallop with Mesclun - Wagyu Beef Brisket Fettuccine - Smoked Farmer's Ham With Kale & Egg Pizza All were really good and we thoroughly enjoyed our meal. Can't wait to try their other dishes.
Peproni Pizzeria,"It was a pleasure dining here as the food was yummy. The restaurant staff Lidia also made the experience that much better with her warmth, friendliness and attentiveness!"
Peproni Pizzeria,"Great pizza place for the family! We ordered half of Hawaiian and half Pepperoni on a 12-inch pizza (you get to mix and match). The crust was thin and the toppings so tasty. For large group, you can try their famous XXL pizza! We enjoyed the baby back ribs which was so tender. For our kids  we ordered the kids meal for them and they enjoyed the pasta too! Our meal concluded with tiramisu which had the right amount of sweetness for our palate. The environment is cosy and suitable for family/group gathering. Oh, we loved their tagline ""All we knead is LOVE""! Service was prompt and friendly. We didn't have to wait long for our food to be served. Staff were attentive and they would check in with us on our food. Parking space is limited, but the restaurant is easily accessible by Thomson-East Coast Line MRT (Upp Thomson station). Certainly must come back again for great italian fare in the Thomson area!"
Peproni Pizzeria,"Loved my experience here! Staff are nice & accommodating, even sent my chicken back for the staff to help me cut as it was quite hard to cut into! Affogato is nice!! The chicken main dish is HUGE and worth the money. Love pizzas."
Peproni Pizzeria,Food is not bad. Hummus and avocado tomato antipasto were tasty. Ordered the large pizzas. Taste was nice but rather thin. Fairly pricey menu. Desserts were nice. Waiting staff friendly and helpful. Lady staff was cheerful and welcoming.
Peproni Pizzeria,"Went on a Thursday night, not very crowded, promptly seated. Staff were very friendly and helpful.  We got the Salmon Pizza and mixed XXL Pizza (Crispy Bacon Pizza & Meatballs Pizza). Salmon Pizza was delicious but the there wasn’t a lot of salmon to go around.  XXL pizza was a little lacking in the dough department — crust was heavily burnt on one end and very very thin. Added extra toppings for the XXL pizza too but still, didn’t feel like there was any extra given.  Might come back again but I’d stop at the large pizza. XXL pizza really ain’t worth the dough imo"
Peproni Pizzeria,Came around 6pm and saw the place was already full house. The grilled vegetables pizza is good with variety of ingredients. Four cheese pizza is kind of bland in my opinion. Thin crust pizza dough is approved by me. The edge of the pizza was burnt at the second time I takeaway. It's not too special but a good option for family to share when going for the Xxl size which I think will be suitable for family.
Peproni Pizzeria,"pepperoni :pizza:& salmon kale :leafy_green: (surprisingly yummy!) - unfortunately they didn’t cut the pizza properly, we had to cut again as one side wasn’t cut all the way through so a little confused, maybe they were rly slammed with service. otherwise, I just wished the pizza crust was a TAD bit thicker (personal preference)"
Peproni Pizzeria,Superb service and delicious Italian food. Highly recommended!
Peproni Pizzeria,"The food was great. My family & I had 2 large pizzas, 1 lasagne, 1 pasta & 2 jugs of iced lemon tea. The service was friendly & efficient."
Peproni Pizzeria,They serve xxl pizza which can serve quite a lot of people. Pizza is nice and it is thin crust which won't make you feel so filled at the end of it. Chicken wing is crispy and tasty at the same time same for truffle fries
Peproni Pizzeria,"Standard seems to be not as good as before. Preferred the quality at Zion road outlet (now closed) could improve on their arrangement of toppings, cooking duration/evenness as well as the char on the crust (needs to be more)"
Peproni Pizzeria,"The XXL pizza is a must try for the novelty. Fried chicken was very juicy. Overall, it's a good pizza place with good service. Good for gathering and sharing the oversized pizza. Will visit again."
Peproni Pizzeria,"Great pizza, thin, crusty and with tasty toppings. There are 3 sizes of pizza, the middle size (L size) can be for 2 people, bit if you are hungry, then this is for 1 person. The largest (XXL) size is definitely a family size pizza."
Peproni Pizzeria,"A nice & quiet place for dinner before the crowds come. The pasta was well-cooked and the taste was just right. The XXL pizza was huge & needless to say, it was so delicious & value for money really. I’m not eating other pizzas anymore."
Peproni Pizzeria,"Had a couple of Pizza and few beers . The white pizza half and half was awesome. The pepperoni pizza was pretty decent, although it was supposed to be heavy on salt and oil off the pepperoni, it was just extremely heavy on both salt and it was way too oily. The service and ambience was good."
Peproni Pizzeria,"Loved the tomato based pasta, creamy base is alright but not as potent. The mushroom soup is good as well."
Peproni Pizzeria,Very bad service from Frankel branch. Very disappointing.  Pizza ingredients were not generous enough. $16(excluding gst n charges) is too high.  I have emailed to the team. Hope you will take a look and review. Thank you.
Peproni Pizzeria,"Knowing that every restaurant in Singapore would be crowded, we decided to order in for lunch. We got three pizzas and I have to say they were amazing. It was not our first time eating Peperoni, so I believe eating at the restaurant will be better since you receive hot fresh pie."
Peproni Pizzeria,"Happy to visit and have dinner at this new location (we have been going to the one Zion road for the last many years). Celebrated our youngest daughter's birthday. Great food, good friendly service."
Peproni Pizzeria,One of the best thin crust pizza I have had in Singapore. Went for 21 inch pizza and in just no time we managed to finish it!! Staff are very friendly and nice. Will come back again!!
Peproni Pizzeria,prices have gone up so much. taste wise nothing to shout about. size of the pizza is picture worthy and big group friendly but otherwise nothing special. service staff was attentive so that's a plus point
Peproni Pizzeria,"Food was quite good, and the crowd here even in the evening is testament. Great thin pizza. Prices are not cheap, but the pizza and pasta we had were tasty and recommendable. Will come again!  Lots of families with children here too"
Peproni Pizzeria,"One of our favourite places to dine at! The food is great but the star is definitely the great service rendered - family friendly with bright coloured baby chairs, but also sweet and cozy enough for an inviting dinner. Thank you Mr. Muralidaran for making my kids’ day, and all the other staff (a very proactive and kind lady and the pizza chef!). Will definitely be back :red_heart:"
Peproni Pizzeria,"Read some good reviews so decided to order the pizzas(Double happiness set) for self pickup. However on reaching home, was disappointed to find both the pizzas we were given weren't the ones we ordered. Instead of the Super Meaty and BBQ chicken which we have ordered, we were given seafood Fantasy and sunshine Fantasy. The seafood pizza tasted ok but the Sunshine Fantasy had sliced hard boiled eggs in it and I really hated it, I think it tasted weird. My family didn't really like the boiled eggs in the pizza as well.  On top of that, we ordered fried chicken wings, and 4 out of the 5 wings were undercooked, the flesh was still pink  within and a couple of them, especially the bigger pieces were still bloody.  Fortunately, there was a chicken lasagna which I ordered and that I could eat. Even then it tasted just average and nothing special.  I hope the kitchen could get all the orders correct before they hand it over to the customers, otherwise it is very troublesome to bring both pizzas back to change for the right ones. I do not encourage the restaurant to let customers open and check the pizzas and to have them put back if it weren't theirs for it will be too unhygienic. Doing it right the first time should be the way to go."
Peproni Pizzeria,"Ordered the Lady Rose Pizza on the phone and self-collected it from the shop. Friendly owner.  Overall the pizza was okay, love the tomato base. The Lady Rose felt lacking in artichoke but the cheese was adequate."
Peproni Pizzeria,"Decent quality pizza for a pretty good price. Quality of toppings (e.g. Ham) has fallen in the past few years, but price is still competitive."
Peproni Pizzeria,A tastey pizza with very generous and fresh toppings.  Perhaps needs a bit more flavor to stand out.  Take away only. Very nice lady who runs the store.
Peproni Pizzeria,"Ordered two pizzas: Aloha (pictured) and meaty. Enjoyed both especially the meaty which was generously filled with meat. The crust was thin and not too doughy (I prefer thin crust).  Ordered two boxes calamari as my side but it was a little oily. Appreciate if it was drained better next time. But the taste was there, didn't feel like it was frozen.  Overall, I would order again. Delivery was within thr timing selected too. :thumbs_up_light_skin_tone:"
Peproni Pizzeria,":pizza: Food & Taste: Ordered the Carnivore and Beefy Affair pizzas with garlic bread and chocolate lava cake. The Carnivore is my go-to order pizza every single time at Alt. Pizza and I am trying Beefy Affajr for the first time because it has mushrooms. The pizzas are one of the best I have eaten. I love the thin crust, the smokiness of the oven is infused in it. The garlic bread is very buttery inside. The chocolate lava cake was divine. I heated it up and it was oozing with chocolate lava. Definitely my favourite pizza delivery.  :money_bag: Price: Price is good only if they have some promotion  :hatching_chick:Waiting Time: Reasonable."
Peproni Pizzeria,Very nice and cosy place to chill if u live around. Pizzas are great and coffee is amazing too. Tried this chicken sandwich it’s was very tasty n nicely toasted. Only thing that avocado toast was but dry to eat n bread was hard there was no sauce so the whole thing felt a bit dry to eat on it’s own. Hope u guys take that in mind n do offer some sauce by the side. Otherwise the food is fresh and tasty. Staff is polite and friendly. Would recommend this place.
Peproni Pizzeria,"Indulging in Alt Pizza through their delivery service was an absolute delight! The quality of the pizza was nothing short of extraordinary, evoking the same delightful experience as if we were dining in at the restaurant. It's truly amazing how they maintain such excellence even with delivery.  I wholeheartedly urge everyone to seize the opportunity to try Alt Pizza at least once in their life; you won't be disappointed! :)"
Peproni Pizzeria,"This one is the take away outlet. We ordered veggie pizza, garlic bread and lava cake. The taste was decent. I think they should either heat the lava cake before packing for delivery or should provide instructions for heating lava cake before eating. Garlic bread was very soft and mouth melting yummy. You can ask for chilli flakes and oregano."
Peproni Pizzeria,"Atmos not applicable as we had it delivered. But their delivery is really good! Fast delivery, On time and kept hot! Pizza has lovely taste and made fresh! High quality pizza with reasonable prices"
Peproni Pizzeria,The pizza looks good at first glance the cashier was very nice good service oh yeah the Indian guy is very good he should get a raise
Peproni Pizzeria,"There is a female staff here who always in a bad mood. Very unfriendly and rude. Unlike the young indian male staff, he is nice, professional and helpful."
Peproni Pizzeria,"Never had much of a problem at this outlet, have always gotten good service with greetings but the first time, my pizza wasn't warmed, and this was the second time, I ordered drumlets in which I waited for it to be ready but was given wings in which luckily I checked after they passed it to me, I went back to let them know, they changed for me the drumlets but not warmed up. Service wise I would have to say pretty much cold in response. :grinning_face_with_sweat::smiling_face_with_tear:"
Peproni Pizzeria,"All my food was delivered cold (mains and sides), the wrong drink was delivered, and there were no chilli flakes or grated cheese, again. Such a disappointment as I like Pezzo pizzas."
Peproni Pizzeria,Bought the set voucher from ShopBack and redeem at NEX branch. Staff was really friendly and nice
Peproni Pizzeria,"The food was good. Ordered the new rose pasta and chipotle pizza. They were delicious! The ambience was nice however the music they play was weird though, like some techno or EDM (those music they play in clubs)."
Peproni Pizzeria,"I ordered takeaway from this outlet and the pizza I ordered was large pizza simply cheese , the pan pizza I ordered was almost like a thin crust pizza and half of my pizza the crust was more than pizza itself , very disappointing!"
Peproni Pizzeria,"I was at pizza hut Nex earlier this evening. I ordered regular pizza and seafood alfredo. Pizza was good, however I found an unidentified substance item on my mussels. I asked one of staff for assistance because I don’t know whether its safe to consume or not. I overheard one of staff informing her supervisor about the incident and the person reacted  ‘oh SHIT’ out loud until I could hear from my table. Manager on duty Kai approached to our table and took back my plate to kitchen. After few minutes, one of lady staff came and informed me that they will replace it to new dish. At the end it turned out totally new dish which I didn’t order, and no explanation and apologies were given until I ask to speak to manager in charge again.  I had to waste my time there with unpleasant experiences.  I hope pizza hut will take action on food safety and hygiene matter seriously in the future. And please train your staffs for proper way of handling certain circumstances."
Peproni Pizzeria,"I ordered tonight for take away but I asked if it's possible for me to change to dine in since they have lots of vacant seats and I have a headache. However, they didn't let me as per manager's protocol. I understand there are rules to follow but i think it's common sense and empathy to allow a customer to change to dine in since there are only few customers around. It's too restrictive.  Aside from that, there's no queue monitor too. After the male staff gave some take away order to 1 customer, he didn't give the rest. If I didn't go to the station I would not know that my order is ready.  The only good thing I could say is the young female staff, atleast she was polite. Maybe the manager could learn from her."
Peproni Pizzeria,"Not efficient. Everyone seems slow. Call for waiter but walk slowly to us. Even when order is ready, but not served. Only 2 tables occupied, so many empty tables but there is still queue. No wonder business getting lesser. Only focus on online orders."
Peproni Pizzeria,"A unique take on a traditional favourite with its signature sourdough base. Given it’s variety of flavours, you have the option to choose 4 flavours on a single pizza. Fresh and flavourful ingredients on top of smoky charred crust that elevates their pizza to the next level. Seating is limited so feel free to opt for delivery or dine in across the road at the food centre. Highly recommended and am a return customer for sure!"
Peproni Pizzeria,"i must say that Goldenroy Sourdough Pizza's pizzas are one of the most remarkable pizzas I've had in my life. the flavors/toppings of the pizzas are truly unique and you really can taste passion in every bite you take.  it's both amazing and inspiring to see how passionate they are about their food, considering I'm in the F&B industry myself as well.  my pals and i ordered a few different flavors (you're allowed to pick 4 different flavors per pizza) to try, and the owner (i believe) patiently explained their different pizza flavors to me while giving me instructions on how to order.  i highly recommend their mushroom pesto, clam and garlic butter and garlic blue cheese flavors.  we also loved their Sourdough Bomb; these are perfectly made balls of sourdough bread, stuffed with garlic cream cheese and it packs SO MUCH FLAVOR.  I'd definitely place an order for delivery the next time I'm craving pizzas. I must say they could really improve on their process for customers waiting to dine-in; we had to wait about 30-40 minutes for a table and another 30 minutes to get our food. I'd say the process is rather messy and the owner was visibly scrambling to serve everyone."
Peproni Pizzeria,"The sourdough crust is definitely crispy and has an incredible light and airy feel to the dough, unlike other sourdough pizza (more tang and crispy outside and chewy inside). which I also enjoyed.  They have a good range of toppings. Everyone of them are good.  There were 5 of us, and we are all relatively small eater (generally finishing 2 to 3 pieces of sourdough pizza from other places). They recommendeĺd to us to order 3 boxes, and each box has 4 square pieces of pizza. Luckily, we ordered 2 boxes and 1 box of garlic knots. In the end, we ended up bringing 2 pieces of pizza and a knot home. Minimal order is a box (that comes in 4 pieces). If you do order the garlic knots, eat it immediately or heat it up in the oven provided.  Do note they do not charge service charge, so we need to clean up after eating (as noted on each table). Kitchen towels or paper are provided to use as a plate. No eating utensils are available. If you want them to cut the pizza into smaller pieces, you can do so before eating.  I think it is great to takeaway pizza place."
Peproni Pizzeria,"Came here for lunch expecting just another pizza spot but was pleasantly surprised. The crisp that you get from every bite was amazing. I didn't expect the variety in toppings on 1 order of pizza but definitely something I enjoyed thoroughly. 1 pizza is supposed to feed 1 - 2 people, but it was so tasty I could definitely eat 1 alone."
Peproni Pizzeria,"This is easily the best pizza I have ever found in Singapore. San Francisco-style pizza, cooked and served piping hot. They offer you the option to purchase up to 4 delicious flavours on the same pizza at no surplus cost. There are these very unique toasters on every single table that even allow you to re-heat pizzas that you've taken too long to eat. Overall, a wonderful experience and a place I will definitely visit regularly."
Peproni Pizzeria,Affordable And Yummy Pizza!  Tastes different from its Philippines counterpart but in a good way.  Pizza toppings seems more premium and cooked fresh.  The mount of pizza and toppings you get is bang for your buck.  Pizza is thin enough to hold the topping while maintaining a soft dough.  Past is also good.  You have to try the four seasons pizza and charlie chan pasta.  Chicken wings are also yummy.  Doesn’t get crowded and has a ton of seats even outdoor ones.  Service is good might need to wait a while for the pizza because its fresh!  One of the better fast casual pizzas in Singapore for sure!
Peproni Pizzeria,"I came here on a recommendation by a friend. She loved the Philippine’s branch and asked me to try it in Singapore. The restaurant was almost at the end of Esplanade MRT (maps doesn’t show that). It was calm and had good options. I tried Charlie Chan pasta, and god it bombarded with flavours. Perfect spice and great taste. It is also mentioned that BBQ chicken Pizza is great, but I haven’t tried it."
Peproni Pizzeria,"Good thing is no service charge. Their pizza is just ok. Nothing to be impress. Minimum service. By the way, their cloth wiping table was terrible. Very smelly and I can even smell it after table has been wipe."
Peproni Pizzeria,Walked in restaurant during Christmas Day. Not crowded during the lunch hour that day. Four season pizza is good. We love the potato skin with cheese and bacon. The pesto pasta a bit too dry for us.
Peproni Pizzeria,Nice quiet place located at one end of city link. Prices are very reasonable and there is Happy hour for beer lovers.
Peproni Pizzeria,"Walked in for lunch because I was craving pasta, and I'm happy to say that the standards are still high. I've been coming here for many years and the food is still very good. I highly recommend the crab meat linguine, and fritto misto (fried calamari and prawns). The caesar salad is also good. The complimentary baguette they serve is of very high quality."
Peproni Pizzeria,Best Italian food in SG. Everything was well cooked and bursting with flavour. Draft beer was fresh too. Came here to celebrate my brother's birthday and booked a week in advance so we were able to secure seats. It was a Saturday night 6pm booking and we were told to clear by 8pm for the next batch so I assume it must be v popular. 2 hours was sufficient to enjoy the food here.  The complimentary bread with olive oil and vinegar was so yummy we paid for another basket. The bread was well toasted - crunchy outside and fluffy inside. Dipped in oil it made for a great starter.  We then ordered the octopus. Most well cooked octopus i had in SG. Tasted like lobster - soft and melts in your mouth. The pizzas were well baked too with the ingredients generously falling off the slices. Ingredients used were of high quality and went well with the baked dough to make a delicious pizza. The tomato base pasta was superb and each mouth was bursting with flavour. The cream base was cooked well but paled in comparison to the tomato based ones. Then again could be taste preference. But try the tomato based ones first.  We ended with the meat medium rare but by then as all the previous dishes brought so much flavour to the table it did not taste as spectacular. Next time I'll skip the meats and order the others.  Beer on draft was superb and paired well with pizza. Service was also good enough.  Bill was around $40-50 per pax. Money well spent. Will definitely come again.
Peproni Pizzeria,Arguably one of the best sourdough I’ve ever had.  Pizza and pasta for set lunch were flavorful and not overwhelming.  Cherry tart were delicious and not sweet.
Peproni Pizzeria,"We ordered pizza, beef tartare bruschetta, steak and a bottle of wine for just 2 of us. Everything was good and we had a good time. Ate too fast and only managed to take the picture of the pizza. The bread for the bruschetta was so good, crispy and moist, just perfect with the beef tartare."
Peproni Pizzeria,Wow wow wow wow :star-struck: this is the best pizza i ever had in Singapore. This is our third time here and we gonna come back :heart_suit:
Peproni Pizzeria,"Happened to choose it because of a Burpple offer. The shop looks normal and quite empty. Pizza looks like it's just a simple takeaway place with cold pizzas. However, the pizza that we ordered was nothing sort of amazing. It was the right texture, taste and price. Great place for affordable pizza if you're around the corner!"
Peproni Pizzeria,"Pizza bottom crust is crispy and toppings are generous! The pizza dough is just nice - not too thin, not too thick and has a good mouthfeel.  Great that it’s halal too. Will definitely come back regularly when I want a quick bite"
Peproni Pizzeria,Affordable and delicious pizza. Super friendly owners too!
Peproni Pizzeria,"Very cheap at $6.50 per slice. Fast and easy service. Food tastes okay; not the besssst pizza but can pass. Had american, napoli and hawaiian!"
Peproni Pizzeria,Simply love their hospitality! This is the 2nd time we gathered in a group of almost 50 pax to celebrate at this pizzeria and everyone enjoyed the spread of pizzas!
Peproni Pizzeria,Staff there are friendly better then the old one’s. The staff also asked whether if I wanted to heat up the pizza. Must try especially the Satay pizza.
Peproni Pizzeria,"Pic 1 is Lazada promo personal pan, pic 2 is regular from store direct. Size difference i can understand, but ingredients difference like a discounted price with discounted ingredients, no promo at all. Worse is the malay staff that was rude and impatient from start, redeem and collect, a few clarification was treated witg short replies to ignored. Not afraid to show attitude, somewhat even other users feedback since months, outlet still not action or help him or situation, prefer losing customer and tarnishing the brand. Nobody was ordering, he was always busy making pizza. When i stood there for 5mins waiting for him to finish, he moved on to make the next pizza. I wonder what can piss him off all the time, i asked why so upset. I have not order personal pan before, if this is the standard, i guess I won't buying again. Thanks, i know business is tough, but service is still important, even if your promo damn good, i may think twice"
Peproni Pizzeria,Ordered delivery from them once and the pizza came stone cold even though we live very nearby the shop. Tried to give them a second chance today by eating there in person and the pizza was only slightly heated up and not crispy. Very disappointing compared to other outlets.
Peproni Pizzeria,"Good food, the pizza is not to expensive. Staff there are friendly with nice attitude. Highly recommended to try their pizza. Especially the Raya special Satay."
Peproni Pizzeria,Pizza here is better than the other brands. Not to expensive compared to their topping and sizes. Staff there are all friendly will buy from here again.
Peproni Pizzeria,"What’s there to complain? $5 bucks for this entire pepperoni pizza with New York crust. It’s delicious. And I prefer them to Pizza Hut anytime. The only bad thing now, they don’t provide you with free Parmesan cheese anymore."
Peproni Pizzeria,"Ordered at 1147hrs. Couldn't get through to customer service from 1250hrs onwards. 1310hrs they casually call me and say ""PoWeR TrIp"". Customer service hotline is there as a formality since no one answers anyway, line gets cut off halfway they dont bother to call you back. Absolute worst experience I've ever had."
Peproni Pizzeria,"Visited 22/6 Order truffle mania Cheese infused w truffle awesome, order regular size. Thin baked crust super fresh  Try to eat in their store"
Peproni Pizzeria,"Placed an order for dinner around 7.30pm and at 8pm they’re calling to say “are you willing to wait 3hrs for delivery”. Was I supposed to wait will 11pm to eat dinner?! I think if you’re overwhelmed with orders, you should update your site with an expected waiting time for delivery or call customers to let them know immediately an order is placed. At least they can search for other alternatives instead of waiting…"
Peproni Pizzeria,"Ordered from 11:25 a.M to treat my colleagues for Hari Raya. The food hasn’t arrive and its already past our lunch time which is 1:25pm No update not even ETD. I called the hotline well and my it’s been busy for hours. Worse part, there’s no option to cancel order from the app.  Terrible!"
Peproni Pizzeria,"Visited 31/05/2023, Wednesday hot and sunny afternoon. The following sharing are based on our unbiased personal opinion and experience  Was running errands nearby this location and since it's tea break time. I walk over to this Sonny's Pizza :pizza: to grab a bite and take away at the same time.  The place is located around Clarke Quay and the place can be missed of you don't pay attention enough. Everytime when I walk into this place, the interior is stuffy and air ventilation probably not as good. So dining in for me is not a good option.  The pizza :pizza: are handmade and come in 2 sizes 12"" and 18"" other than the single slices their selling. I picked up the pepperoni :pizza: and butter chicken in half half each.  Happily paid for my order and waited patiently 20 mins for my pizza to be made and ready. The pizza taste pretty decent and value for money.  Staff was pretty helpful as well. Overall a good experience for me."
Peproni Pizzeria,"Pretty good pizza joint,  Pizza is precooked and heated for you upon order so wait times are considerably short.  I loved the mapo tofu pizza but it was quite spicy. Your tongue gets buzzed from both the spice and the good blend of flavours, I've never had pizza like that before  Loaded fries are really good value, thick cut fries, nacho cheese and proper bacon.  Music and beer selection is good  Only complaint is the lack of a/c and small indoor seating space"
Peproni Pizzeria,"Great pizza here amidst the various bars! My friend and I will come back again! :face_holding_back_tears:  As it was our first time, we asked the staff what was nice and went with his suggestions of pepperoni and steak & cheese (the other popular one is the big supreme or something along those lines).  The food was served hot and wow they were real tasty!! :thumbs_up: Quickly snapped the pics and started eating :face_with_tears_of_joy: It’s not sooo oily so it didn’t give sinful vibes as we ate! :smiling_face_with_halo:  Also, eating by the roadside on the high tables and chairs with nice lights opposite us gave a nice vibe to the whole dining experience!"
Peproni Pizzeria,"We came by here a few nights ago for a late meal. It’s probably the closest you can find in Singapore to real NY style pizza and it’s available by the slice. The place is not large but they have indoor and outdoor seating and the turnover is reasonably quick. We tried the pepperoni, the sausage & peppers, and one of the specials (it was basically a Hawaiian). All were good if perhaps a little too chewy. I’d like to try a slice or two when they’re fresh out of the oven and not reheated. They also have a very large selection of craft beers and other drinks. Service was friendly and unpretentious. Prices are reasonable. We will definitely go back and try more. I’ll update this when we do. On the second visit, we tried cheese, more pepperoni, and a spinach and mushroom. All were good."
Peproni Pizzeria,"""Service"" as bad and cold as the space is stuffy. I'm not against a 10% service charge but not when it comes with the biggest serving of bombastic side-eye simply because the owner was obliged to step away from his laptop on a weekday afternoon with virtually no other customers.  I was sullenly asked if I was ready (after taking a while to consider all the pizzas and drinks, and again, with NO OTHER CUSTOMER in sight), and made to repeat the order for my second slice. Never have I felt so unwelcome at a food place that my sole priority was getting out of there faster than a sinking tech company about to undergo its 2nd retrenchment exercise in a year.  The owner's speediness in responding to negative reviews of their food but not their non-existent service, is telling of his arrogance and that's not the kind of business you'd wanna support. There are far more places that serve good pizza with better service, and believe me, the bar is in the basement here."
Peproni Pizzeria,"One of the worst pizza delivery place.  Pre-ordered the pizza 1 day before. The delivery timing was set 11:15 to 12.15pm. I even gotten the confirmation email which states that my order has been received.  Understandably, today is Xmas Eve so I expected that there would be some delays. At 130pm, I've yet to receive the pizza, so I called to check the status. The one who answered the call said it will be delivered by 2pm.  At 230pm, it is still NOT delivered. So I called again, this time, they just simply tell me my order is missed out hence cancelled.  And the worst thing is the unapologetic attitude of the woman who picked up the call. What she told me was, you want you take the refund or you wait another 1 hour plus for the pizza. No sorry whatsoever. And i waited 2.5 hours for pizza delivery which never arrived.  One of the worst. Please don't ever order from them."
Peproni Pizzeria,"There's a plethora of problems with this place.  1) Ordered pizza set at 6.20pm with the delivery time slot put at 7.15-8.15. order only came at 9+.  2) Calls to obtain the tracking status of the delivery were unresponsive and the webchat was extremely slow in replying as well.  3) Pizza came and were ice cold. The pizza looked and tasted like store bought pre-made pizza which was reheated (in which case, should not have taken that long to deliver).  Definitely the last time I'm ordering from this place and I urge the rest to think twice before ordering. A place has to be abysmal to get all 1 * reviews."
Peproni Pizzeria,"Pizza did not arrive. Delivery was 24th Dec 5.45-6.45pm. Calls to them r engage, chat on the website, no revert even though state online. And my chat disappear after a while. Email sent but no revert. Hungry and disappointed kids. Till now still no reply from them."
Peproni Pizzeria,"Absolutely rubbish, order came an hour late, food was stale and tasted like the cheap pizzas from supermarkets, even the supermarket instant pricier pizza tastes better. Hotline does not even ring, social media no replies. As you can see on their web they promised a “live chat” which is disabled. Basically no way to contact them other than email.  Do yourself a favor and stay away from them, what a waste of money and time. Look at their followers on social media, majority are fake Russian accounts. I wish I had seen all the negative reviews and all the warning signs before I ordered."
Peproni Pizzeria,Unfortunately true reviews can't be found easily on this pizzadelivery.com.sg since this website actually belongs to Wildfire Pizza. The pizza was late and cold on delivery. The dough was hard and thick. The crust were consistently thick throughout so probably were machine made instead of hand kneaded. Look nothing like the thin crust pictures on their website or the paid ads by food bloggers. The contact number listed on the website is also unreachable...maybe intentionally so.. Definitely not recommended.
Peproni Pizzeria,"The menu is unique, taste is unique too! Our family loves overly pizza!!  P.S- for cheezy salted egg fries, I can't taste the salted egg. I tasted bbq flavor instead..was quite disappointed to see the amount of cheese given..otherwise, all was good!"
Peproni Pizzeria,"Ordered the pizzas online and had them delivered within the time stated on the order confirmation page (80min). Pizza crusts are thin and crispy. The toppings are decent amount and nice (we had the mentaiko ocean, truffilicious wild mushroom, marshmello oreo crisp 24k gold). Delicious pizzas which we'd be ordering again in future.  Some areas which they can improve: it'll be easier if we can order and pay online (currently deliveries are paid cash on delivery) and, also indicate that the order's details (pizza type ordered, time delivered etc) will be emailed on the order confirmation page"
Peproni Pizzeria,Ordered Mentaiko Ocean and spicy prawns. The Mentaiko was absolutely perfect with the roe beads bursting in the mouth and very flavorful and fresh seafood. Also to mention their pizza crust is very crispy and buttery :thumbs_up:. Highly recommended
Peproni Pizzeria,Ordered my favourite set meal $49.90 ( 4-6 pax) ~ (L) HOKKAIDO TERI-CHIKI ~ (R) TRUFFLICIOUS HAWAIIAN ~ CHEEZY SALTED EGG FRIES ~ BELGIUM CHOCO LAVA CAKE - 1 Bottle SOFT DRINK  Love their thin crust pizza. Although it came by delivery service but it still tasted really flavourful and yummy.
Peproni Pizzeria,"Thank you @overlycheezysg :cheese_wedge::pizza: for sending over my favourite THIN crust pizza and sides :smiling_face_with_heart-eyes::face_blowing_a_kiss: just in time for my binge watching of the FIFA World Cup 2022 :trophy::soccer_ball:  𝐓𝐑𝐔𝐅𝐅𝐋𝐈𝐂𝐈𝐎𝐔𝐒 𝐇𝐀𝐖𝐀𝐈𝐈𝐀𝐍 :falafel::pineapple::bacon::cheese_wedge::pizza: Easily their signature :writing_hand: pizza, I can understand why.

Peproni Pizzeria,Service over here is impeccable and I was very impressed with the staff. All friendly and polite.. the food was equally as good as well. Pizzas were loved by my kids and I enjoyed my tomato based seafood linguine. Two thumbs up!
Peproni Pizzeria,"Food was sooo good and staff were super friendly and welcoming. We accidentally spilled a wine glass and they were kind enough to give us another. Really impressed with the service, ambience and yummy burrata pizza!! 10/10 recommend :)"
Peproni Pizzeria,"Looking for amazing Italian cuisine in Robertson Quay, this is the place. Popped in gor a quick lunch and can certainly say I will be returning!  From the moment I walked in, the cozy ambiance and friendly staff made me feel right at home. The menu offered a wide variety of dishes, but the ones that truly stood out were the Ratatouille Con Gamberoni, the Italian Beef Burger, and the Pizza Arrosto Di Manzo.  The Ratatouille Con Gamberoni was a delightful combination of flavors. The perfectly cooked prawns were succulent and paired beautifully with the rich and flavorful ratatouille. The dish was a harmonious blend of fresh vegetables, aromatic herbs, and tender seafood, leaving me craving for more.  I wouldnt normally opt for a burger at an Italian place but this was a great surprise! The juicy beef patty was cooked to perfection and topped with ripe tomatoes, savory Parmaham, and peppery arugula. The combination of ingredients created a symphony of flavors that danced on my palate.  Lastly, the Pizza Arrosto Di Manzo was a true masterpiece. Each bite was a burst of savory goodness, and the quality of the ingredients shone through in every mouthful.  In addition to the outstanding dishes, the service at Bella Pizza was impeccable. The staff was attentive, knowledgeable, and passionate about the food they served. They made sure that my dining experience was enjoyable from start to finish.  Overall, my visit to Bella Pizza was nothing short of exceptional. The Ratatouille Con Gamberoni, Italian Beef Burger, and Pizza Arrosto Di Manzo were all outstanding dishes that showcased the culinary expertise of the restaurant. Coupled with the warm atmosphere and attentive service, Bella Pizza has definitely won me over as a loyal customer. I highly recommend this place to anyone seeking a memorable dining experience filled with delicious Italian cuisine."
Peproni Pizzeria,"Came to Bella Pizza for a mid-week brunch with friends. We shared a lasagna, pasta and pizza as well as calamari and tiramisu. Lasagna was good - best eaten warm though. Enjoyed the tomato sauce on our pizza, got a nice crust to it. Very generous with the seafood in our pasta. Personally, my favourite was the tiramisu - it was sweet and light. The staff were really nice and friendly too."
Peproni Pizzeria,"Awesome experience in Bella Pizza. Initially, we had a reservation for Bella pasta. However, the staff in Bella pasta made us wait for a ridiculous amount of time. We were placed in Bella Pizza instead and the staff made it so easy to patronise the restaurant. Amazing customer service and easy communication. Not to mention very fast delivery of orders with quality tasting as well. Very very highly recommended."
Publico Ristorante,"The restaurant is spacious and able to make reservation during weekends. Menu serve good variety of food and drinks. The staff are nice and efficient. Overall, I think is a really good place for gathering for friends and family. There are indoor and outdoor seats as well. For outdoor seats, they allow pets."
Publico Ristorante,"Came to this place with a group of friends.  I’ve tasted better Italian food in Singapore, so I find the selections to be rather mediocre.  But the tiramisu is a must-try! Love it!  The service is decent and ambience is perfect for a date."
Publico Ristorante,"Came here for Mother's Day Brunch with my mom and our miniature schnauzer and we had the best time. The service and food was impeccable and this is possibly one of the best pet-friendly Italian places we've ever been to. A special shout out to Sarah who gave us great recommendations on the food and kept checking in on us, as well as Jasmine who was there to help us if we needed anything. Great staff, great food and great ambience. Will be back for more! Carne pizza was superb. Keep it up!"
Publico Ristorante,"Nice food and a good meal. Sadly a lot of food unavailable due to the weekend crowd. I think an inventory manager should be hired, how can this be happening. Service staff was attentive and bartender made a nice drink for us. Nice touch from the staff for giving us a free birthday cake!"
Publico Ristorante,I was staying in intercontinental and their breakfast is served here. Wide variety of food that serves every taste bud. Layout is very good and u will get seat as you arrive. They have live station for eggs which is very good. Their bakery section is very good. Good option for coffees and fresh juices. Overall it’s a good option for breakfast. Staff is very good and polite. They also offer to go breakfast in case u r in hurry
Blue Label Pizza & Wine,"This place serves fantastic pizza! Would recommend sticking to the pizza with the thin crust. Ordered The Slim Shady detroit-style pizza but it tasted very much like pizza bread instead. Nevertheless, the flavours were good! Kale Waldorf Salad and carrot cake were brilliant too. Prices are on the higher end though."
Blue Label Pizza & Wine,"Was planning a place to celebrate my daughter's birthday, and she requested for pizza so we went to search for top pizza places and blue label came up.  Turns out to be very pleasant experience for us!  Firstly the service was really awesome, Audrey (hope i got her name right) was really attentive, and offer many advice, given that we have kids and no-pork requirement. She's always making sure we have things covered, and it's the tiny details that really amaze me. E.g. The beer pitcher was always put in a bucket of ice while we r having the beer in our mugs, so we always get ice cold beer. And we got little cookies as gift for my daughter's birthday.  Ambience wise, I love the American diner design. The place is not huge, but it was nice and cosy. The dining setting are done nicely with wine glasses, not what I will expect for a pizza bar. And the music is the kind of music that I love (rock and metal), but not too loud so we can still talk.  Lastly the food, definitely the best pizza I had. We got the original signature and piggy+pineapple (as my kids love Hawaiian). The cheese are made with fresh cheese and the meat are of tasty bacon and ham, and the crust is the kind of thin and crispy dough that I love. Top it up with their home made chili mala oil, really elevate the taste.  Only feedback I have, is if they can do a half-n-half for the pizza so we can try out more flavors!  Will be back again for sure, especially that it's super near my office! Cheers to the team for making this a pleasant experience for us!"
Blue Label Pizza & Wine,I’ve been to blue label both outlets few times and service and food have always impressed me. I can say they have the best pizza I had in Singapore so far. Crust is crispy and thin. Ingredients are fresh and taste is unique. The pizza size is quite big and good for sharing between 2. Service is efficient and nice environment. I’ll definitely keep coming back when I crave for pizza. Good job guys!
Blue Label Pizza & Wine,Can not fault this place!! The food is Absoloutley amazing with a crust base for the pizzas and unique toppings! The chick parmigiana bites were amazing and the wine list is delightful and extensive. We went there for an Estonian seating and the service was top notch! It was my 31st birthday and they gave us a slice of complimentary ice cream and carrot cake which was delicious! Highly recommend!
Blue Label Pizza & Wine,"First time visiting the Blue label pizza and I must say I was missing out on so much. It is a quaint pizza place located in a side back alley but the food was delicious. The kale Waldorf salad :green_salad: yes you heard me right a salad at a pizza place was JUST AMAZING!!!! I can't recommend it enough. We also tried the chicken wings and the state fries, both were good. For pizza we ordered the J-Dog which I personally found it a bit salty but tasty nonetheless and for the vegetarians out there you have to try the Green Machine, it is delicious :face_savoring_food::face_savoring_food: I will definitely be going back for some of that salad :smiling_face::check_mark_button:"
Blue Label Pizza & Wine,"Service is top notch, the type that you find in places that tip. Decor is posh American diner style. Don't be deceived by the blue exterior wall and lack of windows, it's actually quite homely once you sit down and start to enjoy yourselves.  Food is very good. Pizzas are thin and crispy and even the bread is flavorful without the toppings. There's definitely pizza preferences here, so choose carefully and explore after you've had your favorites.  Good for dates and friend groups."
Blue Label Pizza & Wine,Love the American vibe. Spinach and artichoke dip was awesome. We also ordered American Pie Pizza and Mr Pepperoni Pizza. The crust was superb and made more yummy with their fresh ingredients. Their selection of wines was excellent. Make even better if you come during their happy hours.
Blue Label Pizza & Wine,"Good experience from start to finish. Very cozy and plush booth seats with nice selection of yacht rock music. Pizzas were to die for. Thin crusted, tasty dough, generous and delicious toppings, well worth the slightly higher price. Go for the high end Pizzas, won't regret it. Had a good time. Nice wines at a great price during happy hour $12 per glass."
Blue Label Pizza & Wine,Strongly advised to reserve a table as the place is quite small. Every table was given a strict 90mins dine in time. Music was a little loud. We prefer the truffle pizza (cash in cash out) than the octopus pizza (summer in San Sebastian). Chicken wings were alright. Artichoke dip was great! Earl grey tea (comes with honey water) was nice too.
Blue Label Pizza & Wine,"Everything was perfect. Food, atmosphere and even the staffs were attentive and friendly. Their pizza dough was so crunchy and chewy, I guess they use corn meal as the base of it which makes it so much better than those ordinary ones. Even the signature salad was also very tasty. Brussel sprouts were fresh and we loved how nutty and cheesy it was. Best pizza place in Sg."
IO Italian Osteria,"Very busy Restaurant! A big open concept kitchen and a bar on the opposite side. The atmosphere is casual and feels very comfortable.  Staff were friendly and as we do not have a reservation. We were lucky to get a table with 1 hour dining time.  Order the pizza,  special truffle risotto and the cripsy pork belly. Tasty and reasonably priced.  Good place for gatherings."
IO Italian Osteria,Most delicious Italian food I have ever tried before! Highly Recommended for Grilled Octopus :octopus:!! So tender and juicy :pleading_face::face_holding_back_tears: Price was reasonable too.  Atmosphere: abit hot inside (maybe cause window seats?) But service was quite fast! Would come again to try other dishes on the menu for sure!! :smiling_face_with_hearts:
IO Italian Osteria,"Went for a late lunch on a weekday. The place was almost full, had a short wait for the staff to prep the table. Was seated next to the glass window & the heat from outside can be felt, would suggest to put up some window film or screen. Nice interior though. Quite nice tasting Italian pasta with nothing over empowering, nice touch… will opt for the octopus at next visit."
IO Italian Osteria,There is a reason why it is so well booked. Their meats are better than their seafood but their pasta is really their signature. A must try and definitely a revisit on a weekday. Was there on Saturday and it is their most popular day and yet they had enough staff to cover the grounds that I never felt left out…. Really packed and strictly 2 seating on Saturdays.
IO Italian Osteria,"Italian food here are authentic and tasted amazing. We particularly like all of their pasta, burrata salad and grilled octopus. Waiting time could be quite long during dinner. Service could perhaps be improved as our bill was approx $300 and we requested for a candle on the cake we ordered, but they forgot it. After reminding the waiter to give us the candle, he came up with a cake we didn’t want with candle this time then charged us for the new cake. Perhaps just a candle will do?"
Tipo Pasta Bar,"Wonderful service staff who are able to make recommendations and advise about which food fits the level of spiciness you desire. Excellent food, good portions which will leave you satiated. We ate a bowl of pasta each, and ordered a plate of fried calamari. Be sure to add a bottle of cold water ($2) to go with your sweet drinks."
Tipo Pasta Bar,"It's been awhile since I last came to tipo. Glad to realize it's still as good as ever. Enjoyed the chili tomato pasta very much, chewy and unique. The white bait is great as a side and the feta cheese is interestingly done up with a sprinkle of kiwis. Lovely atmosphere to chill though sadly, the coffee machine was down."
Tipo Pasta Bar,"Very good pasta and awesome service staff! All the staff were friendly and served with a smile.  I ordered Pink Pasta with smoked duck, the pink sauce reminded me of my days in Frankfurt :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes:"
Tipo Pasta Bar,"The pasta there was wonderful. I ordered the presto pesto with smoked salmon while my mom ordered the prawn pasta. The pesto was creamy but not too heavy, the salmon was really smokey and the cherry tomatos were super sweet. This place was very unique. The prawn is extremely fresh and juicy , and was perfectly cooked. They have different pastas there every day and you can custom and make your own pasta. Even though i am not a pasta person, this restaurant was the best pasta restaurant i have tried"
Tipo Pasta Bar,"Calamari - 3.75 stars Batter is good, somehow tastes like chips (probably the seasoning).  Overall the flavoured pastas are a little gimmicky and probably affect the texture, making it soggier and not al dente. Reasonable prices and portions but not the best pasta.  Crab pasta - 3.5 stars Not a fan of tomato cream sauces. Good amount of crab.  Fennel and olive pasta - 3.75 stars Good flavour from the capers and fennel."
Pasta Fresca Da Salvatore,"Good place for Italian dining. However very expensive. We ordered the bruschetta and it was very cheap. It had largely diced tomatoes that were hard to chew through. I believed that it wasn’t the best thing ever. Furthermore, the pizza looked deceiving. We saw a bunch of vegetables and lots of onion and thought it wouldn’t taste good but to our surprise, it tasted great! Overall, not a bad place to visit"
Pasta Fresca Da Salvatore,"Food quality is great. Staff are very friendly and helpful, they pay attention to our needs. Many varieties of pasta and very authentic Italian menu. Price is reasonable."
Pasta Fresca Da Salvatore,Love the variety of food choices and awesome service staff’s including the Boss himself that ensure the guests are having a great time :mantelpiece_clock:
Pasta Fresca Da Salvatore,"The calzone was very wet and soggy. When asked if this was normal, a visibly irriated chef was seen gestering in the open kitchen and the waitress came back to inform me this is normal for a mushroom calzone. Service staff were otherwise very good. The pasta was also fairly good."
Pasta Fresca Da Salvatore,"This is my first visit in years. The pasta is still good, u can choose from a wide variety of pasta to go with the sauce of your choice, and that is always welcomed. Though I do think that it is a bit overpriced, hence the 4 stars.  The pizza is good too. They serve the thin crust type, which I like. Crust was crispy with generous toppings :)  If u're looking for a cosy pasta place to spend some time with your family or friends, this is a good place. I would recommend it, but it is not a place for the 'budget conscious'."
Pasta Fresca Da Salvatore,The food here was very disappointing. We ordered the Vegetariana pizza and it was not good at all. The vegetables were still hard and the crust was soggy - nothing like the picture in the menu. Unfortunately even frozen pizza is more tasty than this. The garlic bread was average. Service was at least pleasant and the ambiance is okay.
Pasta Fresca Da Salvatore,"Lovely location next to the river, decent food and a great atmosphere.  Highly recommend the pizzas."
Pasta Fresca Da Salvatore,The food (most dishes) and service were alright and presentation of dishes were all nice. The portion is lesser than what I expected and the Pizza that we ordered was underwhelming.
Pasta Fresca Da Salvatore,"Had high expectations from this Italian joint but all the vegetarian dishes that we ordered turned out to be below average. Vegetables were soggy, and same base was used in pizza, pasta, and soup. Portion size was decent. Overall - not recommended for vegetarian items!"
Pasta Fresca Da Salvatore,"Pasta is good taste, have many shapes of noodles can choose, also have provide vegetarian menu. Price a little bit higher but acceptable."
Pasta Fresca Da Salvatore,"Was there for dinner on a Sat evening with my family of 8 person. We took the inside table with aircon. The ambience is cosy and nice. The taste and quality of the pasta is generally good. The cream sauced pastas are really thick and rich and can be a little to jelak to finish. My Carbonaro is too salty for my liking, it could be due to to bacon in it. If I am not wrong, I think their they used fresh pasta. Price is of mid-high range. Overall we had a great time and enjoyed the dinner."
Pasta Fresca Da Salvatore,"Food was better than I expected. Pasta pomodoro in particular was very good. Pizza was ok. Not crowded on a weekday lunch, and there's weekday lunch specials which keep the bill not too exorbitant."
Pasta Fresca Da Salvatore,"Ordered a Pizza Lecce for delivery. Were tempted by a Deliveroo voucher. Despite us being only a few hundred meters away the Pizza was cold and messed up. And what a bad cold pizza it was - given that it was retailing at $30+ it was so disappointing. A very odd combination of flavors. Sun dried tomatoes which we like competing with a bland cheese and egg. A very unfluffy crust and a dense dough. Super bland and odd flavor combinations. What was that? Haven’t tried the other pizzas, but there were definitely some issues with the dough and baking. Too bad I would have loved to give another good Italian place in the neighborhood a chance, but this made me write a sad and bad review. There is big room for improvement. For superb pizza a few meters and dollars away, ETNA seems to be unbeatable and enjoyable in all ways this pizza wasn’t."
Pasta Fresca Da Salvatore,"ordered the burrata ravioli and crabmeat pasta with white wine and tomato sauce.  while the crabmeat pasta was tasty and well-cooked, the burrata ravioli did not taste like it had stuffing of burrata and black truffle. the stuffing looked and tasted like potato stuffing. zero taste of cheese, not to mention burrata. I initially thought I was served the wrong ravioli and checked with the staff and he said the pasta was supposed to be this.  prices are on the higher side but portions are generous. but do yourself a favour and skip the “burrata” ravioli."
Pasta Fresca Da Salvatore,Kudos & appreciation to Ms May for being an excellent & friendly service staff to us.  She was very patient and very attentive to our needs. So do keep her in your establishment - a real treasure!  Came here to introduce fresh pastas to my family and they loved it. Albeit pricey and could be only eaten occasionally
Pasta Bar,"Best pasta in town. Have tried a bunch of their pasta dishes and there have not been any misses. Favorite go-to dishes are beef raggu, lobster ravioli, and the uni.  The minus would be the limited number of appetizers and sides on the menu. Serving is rather small for the price tag.  Best to make a reservation one week in advance. Generous seating time of 2 hrs."
Pasta Bar,"The quality of the food and service was great, freshly cooked handmade pasta. Lobster ravioli is my favorite. I enjoyed watching the chefs preparing food as I was  seated at the counter. Nice place to chill out with friends. The price is slightly on the higher side, but i still think it's value for money. Anyone craving authentic pasta should give it a try .Make reservations in advance as the restaurant is usually packed with diners."
Pasta Bar,"I had a memorable evening at Pasta Bar. The greeter was amazing, radiating friendliness and positive energy. The food was great, and watching the chef prepare the dishes felt like a well-orchestrated performance. Though disappointed that the Sicilian Cannolo was no longer on the menu, the overall experience was enjoyable. The only minor drawbacks were the dripping air conditioning, which could use maintenance. Despite these small issues, I highly recommend Pasta Bar for its impeccable service, delicious food, and inviting ambiance. I left satisfied and eager to return"
Pasta Bar,"It was quite difficult to get a table here as it’s usually fully book whenever I want to come.  I guess I had some kind of expectation because of that and also because friends had been telling me about the food.  The cocktails was good.  The bread wasn’t great and as for the pasta I didn’t like mine (rigatoni with eggplants), my friend order the lamb pasta and that one was good.  Even if is homemade pasta I feel the price is a big expensive for what you get especially for the side dish, I think the broccolini was 14$. Glad a try it but I wouldn’t come back."
Pasta Bar,"Great service at pasta bar, waitresses are very friendly! The pasta I ordered - Crab Pappardelle and Lobster Ravioli. I sat at the counter and was able to see the chefs making and cooking the pasta :) However, one thing I’ve noticed is that the pasta turns cold quickly and the waitress explained the chefs usually serves it warm and thus turn cold fast. I guess one way to keep your food warm is to sit outside the restaurant under the scorching hot sun, otherwise you’d have to devour it immediately after it’s served and take photos quickly! ;)"
Pasta Bar,"Wonderful service staff who are able to make recommendations and advise about which food fits the level of spiciness you desire. Excellent food, good portions which will leave you satiated. We ate a bowl of pasta each, and ordered a plate of fried calamari. Be sure to add a bottle of cold water ($2) to go with your sweet drinks."

Pasta Bar,"Paid 28$ for a Bolognese, the spaghetti was cut up and stuck together. Judging by how the cheese on top looked, seems like it was microwaved as well. Yikes. Didn't come with cutlery as ordered either. Cheesecake was ok though."
Pasta Bar,Had for grab food . Food was horrendous . Bolognese was super diluted . Packet ketchup taste better than their sauce
Pasta Bar,"Missing item in a supposed one for one deal. When I notified Grab the restaurant insisted the correct portion was given. So no refund or voucher was given. Based on other google reviews, it seems like I'm not the first customer to face this issue also..."
Pasta Bar,"Ordered via Grabfood, had the aglio olio and chili crab pasta. Portion was generous and pasta was good even though it was in takeaway boxes. The chili crab pasta was nicer."
Pasta Bar,Missing food items seems like a common theme here. No refunds provided as well. Grab only provides a voucher that is way below the item value.
Pasta Bar,Pizza crust is similar to something much more in line with… scallion oil naan
Caffe Fernet,"I wanted to express my heartfelt appreciation for the exceptional dining experience my companions and I had at your restaurant. The food was absolutely delightful, prepared to perfection and bursting with flavors. The variety on the menu catered to every palate.  The ambiance at Caffee Fernet was warm and inviting, with tasteful decor and comfortable seating. Despite the bustling environment, we felt at ease, which enhanced our overall enjoyment.  What impressed us the most was the impeccable service provided by your waitstaff. They were not only prompt and efficient but also incredibly friendly and attentive. Despite the busy atmosphere, our requests were attended to with remarkable speed, making us feel valued and well-cared-for.  As patrons, we are genuinely pleased to have chosen Caffee Fernet for our dining experience. The combination of delicious food, great ambiance, and superb service has left a lasting impression on us. Your team's dedication to ensuring customer satisfaction is truly commendable."
Caffe Fernet,"I had such a wonderful birthday celebration here! The smashed potatoes are a must order. The service overall was great, would like to especially thank Javier for his great attention to detail :)"
Caffe Fernet,"Great view and atmosphere, good cocktails and pretty decent food. Their olive oil cake was a highlight. The golden pomfret was good too, aside from having to contend with a few pin bones."
Caffe Fernet,"The food, drinks and most importantly service were absolutely amazing! I come here often and today being Saturday with no reservation I tried my luck and got a table at the bar. Fit was my server and she was AMAZING- had the best conversations and recommendations - the octopus is a must try! And so is the elderflower sour if you are a gin person and like sours! Thank you again Fit - you made my evening!"
Caffe Fernet,Restaurant has a really lovely view of the bay area and also of MBS. Staff are really friendly and helpful which makes the whole dining experience very pleasant. The home made ricotta and the octopus are really good and a must try. The only slight disappointment was the pork chop which was quite tough and dry. Would still go back and try the other dishes they have.
LINO,"1st time visiting this place. We ordered a Pizza, Pasta and 2 sides to share. Overall, the food taste good. Calamari is chewy, chicken wings a crispy and tasty and pasta taste good even when it is cold. Overall, I recommend this place, except if you drive, parking can be a problem there. Limited parking space, and you will need to park along the landed property."
LINO,"Food was good. We ordered calamari and a Caesar salad as starters, and 2 plates of pasta and a salmon fish as mains. All these were for 4 girls and the serving was just right.  Pasta is al dente and we loved it. Caesar salad is also recommended!  Would come again."
LINO,Food is good. People are friendly. I was surprised to see how with just 2 manpower they could manage to handle such a large number of customers. Amazing But car parking can be abit of issue
LINO,"Came here on a Friday night and ordered some pizza and pasta to share with a group of friends. Best dishes imo were the burrata pizza and seafood spaghettini - the burrata cheese was fresh, rich and creamy, and the pasta was packed with umami flavour and they were definitely not stingy in their ingredients (4 prawns and 3 scallops - all were plump and juicy)!!  We also got a tiramisu to share and the waiter was kind enough to sing us a birthday song with his ukulele :party_popper: service was definitely a 10/10."
LINO,"2-course lunch set meal served by lovely, attentive staff. Food was not mind-blowing but good, prices a little steep - not the most value for money, so docked a star.  3rd photo: transferred the burrata from our starter salad to the five-cheese pizza to make it six-cheese :zany_face:"
LINO,The food is really good and delicious. Would say the pasta and pizza are their best and is really tasty and chewy.  The beef cheek was soft and tender but the beef steak was not as fantastic. So do choose the right dish.  One takeback is just that it seems like the people working there are angry or moody. Only one or two staff is enthusiastic. When called for service they will notice and then ignore which makes us wonder if there is a difference in who is serving.
LINO,"Had high expectations because when they were at Shaw Centre I was never able to get a table (mostly my fault because of too short notice). So from there, inherently and indirectly, expectations have been set. The dining capacity at Forum finally allowed me to get seats (easily). But walked away a tad disappointed. Not that the food was bad, no. Just that it tasted familiar when the “long wait” was yearning for that something special. Tried a variety of dishes, and they were fairly good overall. But no single dish stood out. Calamari is my norm, but the flavours here were muted. Maybe the paprika powder did it. I couldn’t taste the umami-ness of the squid. Seafood stew was nubbad but a plain baguette would go better than the focaccia. Then again, this is an Italian restaurant. I forgot."
LINO,"So far one of the two best pizza's I have had beed eating in Singapore. Great tomato passata, decent salami and cheese. All ingredients are fresh and good quality. I was really surprised with short waiting time, just a couple of minutes and all three pizza's have been served. Very friendly and helpful Staff."
LINO,"Amazing pizza, pasta and steak.  The pasta with the prawn is truly worth the wait and the taste is out of this world.  The seafood pizza might not look very convincing, but the taste is surprisingly tantalizing.  The steak (med) is cooked to perfection and the tenderness and juicyness melts in your mouth perfectly.  Will definitely come here again.  Not cheap...but worth it."
LINO,Great service from the attentive staffs. Char-grilled Iberian pork secreto is tasty and baked salmon is just as good. Calamari is very delicious too
Eleven Strands,"Have been here multiple times as I like their handmade pasta. My favourite would be the prawn pesto pasta! Ordered the escargot for the first time, and I don’t think it is worth the money :face_with_tears_of_joy: it is not very flavourful, but the toast on the side is good. I ordered mocha which is thick and flavourful. Lastly, the truffle fries is my all time favourite here. Very savoury and flavourful! Overall, can give this place a try if you are around the area :)"
Eleven Strands,"Easily the best pasta place I’ve ever been to. The crabmeat pasta was heavenly and perfectly balanced. It’s so good that my vocabulary is unable to adequately describe the magical experience.  Truffle fries was really fresh and crispy. Very generous portion size, recommended!  The staff were attentive and we were promptly seated upon arriving around 1pm on a weekend — no waiting in line!  Complimentary cup of water was a nice touch and the ambience was really laid back but classy. Table for 2 was a little on the smaller side so it would be kinda a tight fit if you’re planning to get more than 2 mains + 1 side for 2 pax.  Otherwise, really positive experience and Eleven Strands is now my favourite pasta place. Will definitely be back a little too often in the future…  Edit: Came back a third time and got the Truffle Mushroom Cream Pasta. The truffle aroma was very apparent and added a new dimension to the cream base. Recommended dish for cream base lovers!  However, recently noticed the a/c was kind of weak. Could be the really hot weather out there, but I was perspiring throughout the meal."
Eleven Strands,Food was pretty good. Oysters were fresh and the burrata was creamy and delicious.  Had the pesto basil prawn pasta and the creamy bacon with their homemade tagliatelle.  Both were great! Especially the pesto pasta
Eleven Strands,"I've been to Eleven Strands on a couple of occasions, and I must say, it was a delightful experience overall! The highlights of my visit were the mouthwatering truffle fries, delectable crab pasta, and an indulgent dessert that left me craving for more.  The staff at Eleven Strands were incredibly friendly and accommodating. They were quick to assist and made sure I felt welcome throughout my meal. Despite the slightly echoey atmosphere and the noise that can arise when the place gets busy, the wholesome food made up for it.  I would strongly recommend making a reservation as this will ensure a more relaxed dining experience without any unnecessary waiting."
Eleven Strands,"Pasta is worth every penny spent! We ordered bolognese and crab meat pasta, both tasted fantastic with a unique and balanced taste. Quality food and reasonably priced. Will definitely be back to try other pasta on the menu. Ambience is nice and service is great, the food came really fast"
La Mensa,"For one of the most unassuming places, the pasta is perfectly cooked and aldente! The flavour was not compromised as well, both the cream and tomato pastas were generous and full of ingredients! Made me want to eat more and not stop eating!  The sides like the calamari was one of the freshest and biggest I have seen and eaten, but the fibre holding on the calamari should be removed, almost gagged on it when it went down the throat! However, really amazing place still!"
La Mensa,"Super reliable pasta place ranging between $15-18. Been here way too many times for a quick, quality bowl of pasta. The bolognese is my favorite. Sides of salad, calamari are also fantastic. You really don’t need to be paying $30 for a quality pasta elsewhere."
La Mensa,"Cosy place right in front of tanjong pagar mrt. The pasta came really fast and had generous portions.  The squid ink pasta has a tasty tomato sauce and the pasta was al dente. The squid wasn't chewy and the seafood tasted good .  Chicken Alfredo was pretty standard but had loads of shredded chicken.  The mussels came in a rich and briney broth that's quite addictive, really nice with the bread.  Overall definitely would come again if I was in the area. And it's pretty affordable given the location"
La Mensa,Convenient location with good food at affordable price. Enjoyed the flavourful mushroom risotto and the creamy alfredo pasta. Food was also served promptly.
La Mensa,"Ordered Pesto Pasta with Chicken takeaway, it was very delicious. The amount of chicken and pasta given was sufficient and very filling. Love the addition of chopped walnuts to the pasta!"
Brunches Café,"I like the western foods and the deco. Good place for photography. The dessert and  coffee also good.  This is my second time visiting. Already try the tuna during my 1st visit, today I try the Salmon taste good too. The service are good. My personal view the pricing are slightly on the high side."
Brunches Café,Went for my birthday and thoroughly enjoyed myself. Great food great vibes and super friendly staff. Love the retro deco all around the restaurant!
Brunches Café,Emm…! How to said? It just so vintage cafe! We just drop here got our Sunday tea break with flat white for my hubby and mocha for myself. On the same time ordered a plain waffle with pistachio ice-cream. Turn out the waffles surprisingly so crispy and ice-cream so nutty with pistachio. Definitely will come again for dinner. Make sure we remember to book a seat early next time.
Brunches Café,"Amazing. Great food, great service, cozy ambience and the best live performances. Enjoyed everything I ordered and immediately decided that I’m coming back here again. The singer is amazing and brilliant at brightening up the mood. He even sang our song request!! Love the vibe and definitely gonna be bring my family and friends here in the future! 100% recommend!!! :smiling_face_with_hearts:"
Brunches Café,"Had lunch with a good friend to catch up. The ambience here was great, staff were friendly and helpful. King's salad was great, the chicken was succulent and the salad tasty and 'crunchy' because of the cranberry and sunflower seeds. Had coffee on the rock which was awesome. My friend had chilli crab pasta and beauty tea - both were great! :thumbs_up:"
Symmetry,"Great Location nestled in a funky neighbourhood, with food and drinks exciting the palate with delicious tasted, wrapped with attentive, timely and friendly staff. It's definitely a place I will be returning to again. Thanks to Daniel and Jia Wen for being outstanding in service."
Symmetry,"Nice place to dine with friends. Food here is really very good and there is nice decor and ambiance. They have all day breakfast, some mains and desserts. If you're looking for a casual place to hang out, this is the place."
Symmetry,"Nice cafe suitable for brunch. Have some vegan and vegetarian options.  I tried Symmetry Super Bowl, a very colorful and healthy dish with tricolor quinoa and no lots of greens. The taste is very good but the portion is too small for me.  Considering the price ($25), it would be great to add some baked tofu or sourdough to make it like the real ""main"" dish."
Symmetry,"Went there for 2pm late lunch, ordered egg Benedict, crab egg Florentine, and waffle. Nice food and considerate staffs. Worth to go again."
Symmetry,"Great space and delicious coffee. Highly recommend the bloody marys, packs a punch and excellent well balanced flavour. Food was hearty and good portion sizes. The kimchi okonomiyaki was a little confusing,but tasty nonetheless."
Symmetry,A forward thinking team that genuinely gets the job done reliably. A place I will definitely recommend for recruiting professionals!
Symmetry,Professional team with a personal touch.
Symmetry,:sign_of_the_horns_medium_skin_tone:
Symmetry,
Symmetry,"The professionalism and friendliness of the whole team is outstanding especially Dr Eugene and the staff Jasmine are really friendly and nice to chat with. Anything about my teeth, I would just ask and they would give me suitable advices. I have done my braces in only 1 year and 9 months, is out of my expectation. I am so happy with the result and it’s really look neat and nice when I smile. Thank you for the services. Definitely recommend !"
Symmetry,"I decide to go to Symmetry clinic to do my braces after researching and I totally happy that I made my choice to go Symmetry to have my braces done. All the staff over there is so friendly, welcoming and will answer any enquiries to their best of knowledge. Dr Eugene is so patience when doing my teeth and explaining all the step and stuff I need to know, and he is so professional I don't feel anything when he remove my tooth and I manage to have my braces remove in just 1 year 7 months it was really fast consider I have the braces around 23 year old.  So happy to discover Symmetry and have my braces done over there, special thanks to Dr Eugene and all the staff for all the care and let me have a beautiful and healthy teeth. :smiling_face_with_hearts::smiling_face_with_hearts:"
Symmetry,Dr Eugene is the most patient doctor I have ever met. His technique is so good and he is so patience. I have recommended many of my friends to come here for braces. All the staffs here are nice and polite also. Thank you so much Dr Eugene and Symmetry:smiling_face_with_hearts:
Symmetry,"I had an outstanding dental care experience with Dr. Eugene. He and his team displayed professionalism and friendliness throughout my visit. From the warm reception at the clinic to the attentive and gentle care provided by the nurses, every aspect of the experience was exceptional. Dr. Eugene was highly skilled and took the time to explain procedures and address my concerns, instilling confidence in me. I highly recommend Dr. Eugene and his team for their top-notch dental care and the welcoming environment they create."
Symmetry,"I just finished my braces treatment with Dr Eugene today! Thanks a lot for making my teeth so neat now, didn't expect with the complexity of my teeth condition (extra embedded tooth) also can complete the treatment in less than 2.5 years time. Dr Eugene is super friendly, attentive and professional. I have another 3 friends also went to Symmetry for the braces treatment after they see the outcome in the midst of my treatment. Highly recommended to those who want to get a nice smile!"
SYIP,"Wait of 15mins. Felt that the cafe could do better in table assignment. A long table, could be shared with more people, and a table for 4, could be spilt into 2 separate ones for 2 separate couples for seating.  Minimalistic menu and place. Drinks were $1-$2 cheaper than other cafes but portion as well. Was sad to have a tiny cup of Hojicha latte being served (forgot to take a photo). Wouldn’t have mind topping up $1 for a larger cup.  Had tatter tots, creamy chicken scrambled egg croissant and sweet French toast, with hot long black and hot Hojicha latte.  Overall was a hearty meal for a rainy sunday brunch. Dishes were served pretty quickly. Long black was on the sour/acidic end.  Food was average, nothing to complain as prices were also reasonable (just that drinks can be a bigger serving). The sweet toast was pretty and was happy that it was a thick toast. Tatter tots was a happy side to have at brunch."
SYIP,"Came for a quick lunch.  It’s a small cafe in a rather obscure corner in Little India.  Lovely interior of white and full of young people.  Had the tiramisu. Interesting and has all the makings of one. It’s well soaked and tasty. Had the French toast, looks too pretty to eat. Tasted great but it’s more like super thick toast then French toast. Very instagrammable.  Coffee is decent with oak milk. Friend had espresso and cafe latte.  Overall damage was $50 for this which is rather pricey for me."
SYIP,"A nice and cosy cafe however we found the seating too tight and customers often have to share at long tables. We ordered coffees and mentaiko pasta. The mentaiko pasta was chef kiss, really enjoyed it."
SYIP,Great Hojicha Latte if you are a fan. Food was cooked to perfection and well seasoned. I would recommend you to have a go if you are around the block. It's worth the wait as seats are limited.
SYIP,"Honestly wasn’t worth the queue during peak hours. 1-2pm on a Sunday afternoon.  Nice ambience but not great food. Nice place for chill and coffee only I guess.  Ordered the Recommended Wagyu Don.  Dish was cold and rice came undercooked, almost tasted like instant rice. The dish wash dry even after mixing the egg. Lack of taste overall. Meat was average.  Not worth the price for sure. Won’t be coming back."
SYIP,"Visited 22 July 2023, Saturday. Ambience and service were great, but food was disappointing as our grilled cheese was served visibly burnt (first picture) and we had to send it back as the burnt taste was too strong. The staff were happy to oblige and came back with a non-burnt toast (second picture). Also noticed that the first time, the grilled cheese slices had been flipped so that the more burnt sides were on the bottom (the top was slightly less burnt). I think the kitchen/serving team could be better trained to look out for food that doesn't meet expectations -- chefs could be more stringent in deciding whether or not to send something out, and the servers could be more discerning with that too!"
SYIP,"Let me put it simply, make a reservation and go there already. Went to SYIP on a Monday for brunch to celebrate my wife’s birthday. Was not disappointed at all, of course the place was quiet so was able to go around and taking photos without annoying anyone.  We each ordered our own +some, we did not have breakfast earlier in the day so we polished up everything… the Breakfast Tart, :face_screaming_in_fear:!!! Separately, its such a suitable place for food pictures due to the big windows letting in natural light and white tables.  i know they are doing their jobs but there were only 3 tables occupied however the service team cleaned the table so efficiently making me feel rushed to leave. i would have liked to take a little more time to chill in that beautiful place.  otherwise, excellent experience overall."
SYIP,"Came here for some afternoon coffee :hot_beverage: and was met with a cozy and aesthetic ambience!  Drinks were presented aesthetically and I had the black cocoa and it was not entirely chocolate, but Oreo with a separate milk :glass_of_milk: given. Would have preferred the drink to be warmer though.  Will certainly be back again to try their mains!"
SYIP,"Nice huge space with a minimalist aesthetic. It’s away from crowds, in a newly-built office building. Had the breakfast tart, the breakfast burger, and a slice of hojicha cheesecake. Portions are a tad small for guys but just nice for the ladies. The black coffee tasted a bit weak, unfortunately. But iced white coffee was decent. Service was prompt and generally friendly, but nothing extraordinary. Really enjoyed the breakfast tart which was a nice surprise, while the cheesecake was rich and had a nice tea flavour.  Bonus: the nearby washrooms were super clean and nice!"
SYIP,"Went there on a Saturday noon around 1230 and to my delight there was no q and was given a table straight away. Food , service and atmosphere was :hundred_points: especially the squid ink tiger prawn linguine!  Revisited the cafe on a week day to try out the rest of the menu , this time ,the  pork cheek bowl. It was  was a huge disappointment  , it was dry and the nori tasted very soggy and stale - like it was being left out for some time , even though I ate it the moment it was served ."
Coexist Coffee,"I was surprised to find a cafe that is spacious and chilled, similar to most of the coffee cafe I have been to in Korea. The place was rather quiet as the tables were quite spaced out. The food was really good. Since discovering this place, I went back again twice! Do make reservation if you do not want to be disappointed!"
Coexist Coffee,"Great atmosphere, well decorated. Food quite flavourful but can be quite big in terms of portions. Mostly western fare. Usually quite crowded on weekends, popular with youngsters. Food can be abit pricey but coffee is reasonably priced. Decent service but can be better, staff sometimes forgetful when we request for something."
Coexist Coffee,"The food here is actually really good. Thoroughly enjoyed the bangers and mash! Interior decor is nice and spacious, I would definitely come back to just chill with a coffee and have lunch here. Didn't get to try the coffee since we came by for dinner"
Coexist Coffee,Came here a few times for gathering with friends or just here for their coffee. Food portions are huge here and good. Their carrot cake fries and chicken french toast are unique and worth a try. Seats can be not that baby/pregnancy friendly as there are steps and pebbles around - almost tripped a few times.
Coexist Coffee,"Visit on sat evening. Very peaceful. Order pull pork burger, the food was good. Recommend for anyone ordering the same, can choose the dressing by the side for the salad. The coffee was superb too very nice :thumbs_up:"
Coexist Coffee,"Cafe is located in a building, do note to take the lift to level 7 and walk up to the rooftop. We were greeted by the friendly and warm staff. Didn’t have any reservation and only left with outdoor seating, but the staff immediately moved us in when there was a vacancy. They also checked in with us at the end of our meal, kudos to their service! Ordered the breakfast set and Aglio Olio, honestly the pasta didn’t taste really good (either the herbs or cheese didn’t go too well with the pasta, and slightly oilier than normal Aglio Olio too). The breakfast set was delicious and a good portion, scrambled eggs were soft and fluffy, mushrooms were nicely sauteed and potatoes were great too. Felt that the location is a little too inaccessible and food was on the pricier side, but good to try for experience. The rooftop also provides a good view, and great for taking photos/videos too."
Coexist Coffee,"Visited on 22 July at 9am.  Quite a number of customers at that time so it seems best to head down early to get a table.  Ordered the Butterhorn Croissant, Regular Croissant, a side of scrambled eggs, Goreng Pisang and Ice Cream & Waffle. It was nice to see that options from the dessert menu could be ordered early in the morning!  The pastries were flaky and nice although the butterhorn croissant was just slightly dry.  The scrambled eggs were fluffy, light and well seasoned. As for the goreng pisang, it wasn’t overly sweet and the coconut ice cream accompaniment complemented the dish. The waffles, which came with the same ice cream, had a slight crispness to it and was fluffy.  The place was located on the 8th floor of the building and you had to take an elevator to the 7th floor before walking up a flight of stairs to get to the cafe. Just a little note for those who may have some physical disability.  Would come back to try the other dishes on the menu!"
Coexist Coffee,"930am Sat crowd. Just renovated...Chairs are way way more comfortable now!  Coexist breakfast & Squid ink rice are SOLID. Prawn gamba tasty too but just a touch too oily for me.  Batista lady and order dude are so smiley, warm and friendly :)"
Coexist Coffee,"Been here a few times before the renovation and was completely devastated when it closed down. But now that they’re back I definitely have to leave a well deserved review.  The grilled cheese they make is literally the best I’ve ever tried. They’re extremely generous with the cheese on the toasted sourdough, and when paired with the hearty tangy tomato bisque, it’s a combination I really urge everyone to try. It’s setting the bar so high that I’m going to be skeptical when I order grilled cheese sandwiches from anywhere else.  The squid ink fried rice is also something I absolutely love. It’s not like the squid ink from random eateries where you start to think whether they just use some sort of black food dye. The fried rice is packed with seafood flavour and umami, where the squid ink actually feels like it plays a role in the flavour department. Mixed with the fried squid and ikura, it’s an incredibly unique and flavourful experience.  I’m not a coffee person, but the aroma from the coffee my brother got enticed me enough for a sip and I might slowly turn into a coffee convert from here. I hear they roast their own coffee here!  Staff are extremely friendly too, making sure you have everything you need and giving good food recommendations all around.  Despite the place tucked between some factory buildings, it doesn’t stop the cosy cafe/restaurant from being filled with customers whenever I’m there. Remember to make a reservation if you’re dropping by!"
Coexist Coffee,"Food: Portion is good for sharing and reasonable priced. Drinks: Oat milk option available for just an additional $1.  To find this shop, hop on the lift to level 7 and follow the signs leading to a fleet of stairs. The outdoor seating area offers a peaceful ambiance."
Joji's Diner,"Affordable and classic American Diner food! Food quality was superb and the burger was really juicy. Extra points for serving an entire pickle like they do in the US!  Mixed Berries Tea was really refreshing and the sweetness of the berries served as a palate cleanser of sorts, should you need a break from the savoury but greasy American Fare.  Atmosphere was very enjoyable, thanks to the 2000s hits playlist!  Overall, truly worth a visit whenever you’re in the mood for some American diner food! Otherwise, It would be greater if every table had some Mustard!"
Joji's Diner,"Joji’s Diner was a great experience. I ordered their strawberry smoothie & all star plate & shared the Cajun Squid Fritters with my friends. The food was great and everything adds to the dining experience. The service was a bit lacking in terms of hospitality & warmth. However, the staff were quick to ensure we have seats in the restaurant and we are very thankful for that.  Great western dining experience."
Joji's Diner,"First tried their food via grabfood delivery cause we were craving chicken and waffles, and we fell in love. Cheap pricing with huge portion and value for money. Was delicious even when it's not hot upon delivery anymore. Finally got a chance to try it in their store and it's so good when it's hot! The cucumber mint is fantastic, you can taste real cucumber in the drink. The shop was crowded when we went for sunday lunch but crowd management was awesome. The staff will take down your details and let you know the estimated waiting time so that you dont have to stand outside in the hot sun to wait and queue. They will call you when your table is ready and we love it! Tip for all, there's a prata shop just at the corner so you can actually go over to order a drink and sit and relax while waiting for your table."
Joji's Diner,"Went there on a weekday afternoon and it wasn’t as crowded as compared to when we visited on a Sunday evening. They serve American style breakfast with reasonable price. Ordered the All Star Plate again. Goes well with Coke. Scrambled eggs were well done. Sausage tasted amazing. Bacon was crispy. Hash browns seasoning was just right. All in all, would recommend if you feel like having Big Breakfast!"
Joji's Diner,"My all time favourite place for pancakes.  I love their pancakes, their lamb sausage, the potatoes, the eggs, the ice chocolate… All is good :”) I always return to get the same meal every time. Moreover, the prices are so affordable for how delicious the food is. Not too overpriced."
Lucid,"Lucid; easy to understand. One of the specialty coffee shops that began in the midst of the pandemic that has thrived in the rise of a new wave of cafes. On the hopper - A variety of origins are sourced and roasted at Lucid, you can pick black or white and the intensity that you would like your coffee to be. Hand brews are also available here."
Lucid,"Food is good, crowd is also quite quiet. Do note that there is a change in menu, so the photos online might not be updated.  The salmon toast was nice. The miso butter for the maple scone was also nice.  Good place to chill. And great place for coffee lovers."
Lucid,"Had Ice Black coffee (blend 04) medium dark roast. The staff explained that it was batch brew, prepared fresh daily. Coffee was well balanced, not too acidic.  Ordered the strong white with oat milk. Very fragrant. It comes with single shot so the coffee wasn’t as strong. Would recommend to add another shot of coffee for better enjoyment.  Industrial theme cafe. For a quick coffee or bite. Staff was professional and equipped with good product knowledge."
Lucid,"Minimalist, industrial, raw, fuss-free, clean and clear. Perhaps that’s the state of mind of this sterile place - to strip away all the bells and whistles so that we can focus and be rational and logical. Maybe that’s why it’s named Lucid.  Do not be taken aback by the cold cement and metal structure. The soft humming of the machines and the clear and soft voice of the staff warms up with personality when they welcome and take your order. I was recommended to a lightly roasted and flora filtered coffee to go with my late lunch.  My drip coffee had a blend of white peach, plum, red floras, and I tasted a hint of Earl grey tea as per the tasting notes.  The salmon ciabatta was presented with a soft and evenly toasted bun and the texture of flour completes the farm to table experience. The acidic balance of preserved vegetables and saltiness of the smoked salmon hits the right note with every bite.  I enjoyed a quiet late lunch today and the 2 staff were highly attentive. But when the crowd turns up, it becomes quite stressful to see the 2 of them navigate the orders.  To really enhance the experience, I suggest to invest in designer storage to keep all the utensils in place so that the open kitchen concept remains free of clutter. And also, the management may want to let people return their tray of utensils."
Lucid,Nice coffee shop near Farrer Park with very sleek minimal interiors.  I ordered a iced latte and a hot cafe latte though the hot coffee had a fairly weak taste. Also ordered a pistachio and almond cake which was yum. Fairly priced and good service. Some of the chairs with low backrest are awful to sit on or maybe just a way to ensure quick turnover.

Lucid,"I had my first tattoo - a small commemorative script on my wrist - done with Zelda. She was  very helpful from start to finish - from the design of the script to the touch ups needed. Zelda is warm, inviting and put me at ease during the whole process - and she made it a meaningful and memorable experience by incorporating a cleansing ritual before the tattooing. The tattoo itself is elegant and beautiful and I'm really happy with her work and I look forward to perhaps exploring further with Zelda down the road. Thank you."
Lucid,"I have done a couple of tattoos with Zelda, and she never failed to impress me with every single one of them. The artwork speaks for itself and importantly she gets to know more about the clients and what they want. And she's super-duper friendly, and the conversations with her makes you forgot about the pain while getting a tattoo. Amazing experience and if you're considering getting a tattoo from her don't hesitate, because you are in the safest hand and experience."
Lucid,"Found Zelda on IG and liked the designs she is working on and so I decided to get a wrist ornament with her. The communication was smooth and she made sure to understand my requirements and preferences. I also went thru a cleasing ritual before the tattoo session and it was smoothing and calm. Zelda is very friendly and always check if I'm okay during the tattoo session. Love the final result. No regrets, don't hesitate to contact her."
Lucid,I’ve gotten my first tattoo with Zelda and a touch up with her. I’ve decided to go with 3 more handpoked from her - channeled sigils! It’s been twice I’ve been in her tattoo table and i felt so held and safe in her hands! The designs and colours stood out on my dark skinned really nicely and i appreciate that. The whole tattoo experience on my second time - the channeled sigil - felt really spiritual. We did intention settings and a short meditation before moving forward to the tattoo session. I felt so grounded and affirmed in the tattoos. I will definitely come back again for more!
Lucid,"It was such an wonderful and therapeutic session, let alone I walked away with such a beautiful tattoo :red_heart: Zelda is meticulous and detailed, and patient while I decide the colour and placement and all. I also hearsay that handpoke is much painful than usual machine tattoo, but the pain is so minimum! Zelda is also so easy to talk to and I learned so much from her. The time just flew by.  I requested for an abundance sigil. The ritual and intention setting really drives in the intention and energy, I can feel my chest opening up ever since.  If you have been thinking about it, just go to her. You won't regret it."
Lucid,My first trip to Lucid Eyecare and first purchase of Rudy Project’s spectacles was smooth and seamless all thanks to Syahmah! She guided and was attentive to my needs and also took the time to explain thoroughly on eye care. I do certainly will go to Lucid for future eyewear purchases!
Lucid,"Lucid Eyecare is amazing! Syahmah is so helpful and patient. She took the time to explain all the different lenses for reading, even when it was past closing time. She didn't try to push me into buying anything right away and actually suggested I monitor my vision first. I've never had such great service before! I'm definitely going back to Lucid and will recommend Lucid to my friends and family!"
Lucid,"Lucid Eye care is really professional they did very details for eyes test and give excellent service with caring, friendly, happy face, polite, make me feel comfort no hard sell, They recommend and explain about frame & lens very clearly. So beautiful transparence frame and good quality of lens. You will never regret if you choose this Lucid Eyecare"
Lucid,"My experience with Lucid Eyecare was fantastic from start to finish. Christy was the main person helping me but all the other staff I interacted with were also very friendly and highly professional. From the complementary eye test, to my rush order, Christy and Lucid Eyecare team ensured I got the glasses I wanted, on time and were very patient is getting the fit correct. Communication and information sharing was clear and consistent throughout the whole process, and I liked that the transaction was all handled digitally. This is how you do customer service, highly recommend Lucid Eyecare!"
Lucid,"Adam and his team were detailed in performing my eye check, I have never experienced such service from reputable optical chains. He did a series of eye tests to ensure that I got the right prescription for my contact lens.  I told Adam about my vision issue when driving at night, after looking at my spectacles, he realised what was the issue and did further test to confirm the problem with my existing pair of spectacles which was done at a reputable optical shop.  I was left impressed and would like to share this review in case somebody is searching for a trustworthy, transparent and reliable optical shop."
Lucid,Great place to chill out with friends to have beer and few rounds of darts or pool. You can also flaunt your singing skills with the open KTV there.
Lucid,"Great atmosphere, great staff and great service. Definitely worth going there to chill"
Lucid,Good price during happy hour. $36 for 1 bucket of 6 bottles of Henikein.
Lucid,Nice place to relax and chill out. Service was great too!
Lucid,Homey place . Excellent staff great entertainment  highly recommended :thumbs_up:
Equate,"Equate has excellent coffee. Croissants are good, haven’t tried the ondeh but it looks nice too Probably the best coffee in the area. *update. Added photos to include recent visits"
Equate,"I am a coffee lover who travels around the world and hunts for a good coffee. This place is one of those places.  When I opened the glass door, I instantly greeted by the great coffee aroma.  The place itself is small with a long coffee bar and the opposite situated the sitting area, besides some small stools and table just besides the entrance.  We order a glass of hot coffee latte, a cup of americano coffee.  All taste great and full of good aroma"
Equate,"Chanced upon the store after lunch, located at a small corner. The vibes were on point, clean, staff are nice. Really loved the matcha soy latte, worth the $8. I will come back again."
Equate,Coffee is quite good. There was a very slight acidic taste to it but negligible.  Clean minimalist cafe. Good crowd on a weekday lunch time.  The takeaway cup felt quite small and it was only a 150ml instead of the supposedly advertised 6oz (or ~177ml based on Google's conversion).
Equate,"A cozy and minimalist concept cafe located at Tanjong Pagar Plaza. Their coffee is a bit too acidic for my liking and milk foam is not as smooth.  Their pastries and cakes are very disappointing and not up to my expectations. Their Caneles lacking the caramelised texture crust, vanilla and rum flavour. The cinnamon roll is dry and doesn’t look like freshly bake. The slice of Earl grey cake is a bit dry and lack of the Earl grey flavour.  There are a lot of room for improvements. As much as I like the ambience but I really hope they can improve their quality of coffee and pastries.  As I’m a baker, I have high expectations of French pastries and I think texture of a Caneles should looks like the 3rd photo (which is baked by me)"
Equate,"Superb cafe serving excellent coffee and incredible pastries. This place gets very busy so at times there is a queue to be seated, but it’s all very well organised. These a selection of unique and utterly delicious pastries to choose from, and there’s a great menu with savoury breakfasts & lunches. Everything is so beautifully presented, and tasted so good. The cubed croissant was on of the best sweet pastries I’ve ever had - perfect balance and flavour and sweetness. Highly recommended!"
Equate,"This new cafe is really crowded & popular. Food is reasonably priced & delicious too. Portion sizes are good & definitely will fill the stomach, especially the sandwich which we had to share. We didn’t quite like the coffee as it was slightly sour for our taste. The tables are also quite small especially when sitting 3 pax. Hardly enough space to put our food & drinks. Forgot to mention, the butter croissant :croissant: was one of the best we eaten. Really really good."
Equate,The sandos were really good as the bread were crisp and buttery. We got the Spam Truffle Egg Mayo and Buttermilk Kimchi Chicken which were both very flavourful.  Cold Truffle Pasta was nicely seasoned.  Truffle fries was nice and crisp.  Fans of matcha should order their matcha latte which was so rich and earthy!  Instagram: @smolbelly
Equate,Coffee is typical and good enough for the usual price tag. Cold pasta was nice though on the saltier end. I enjoy the chocolate hazelnut pastry the most. Many items were out of stock today so we didn't get to try the tonkatsu sandos. Long queue with 1-hour dine in time for PH.
Equate,"There was a queue during weekend but the line moved quite fast for single diners. So far I had tried the earl grey iced tea, halibut sandwich and no.50 drink. The sandwich had a strong smell initially but upon eating it, it reminded me of MacDonald's fish o fillet. The bread was soft and buttery. I will be back to try the rest of the drinks."
Group Therapy Coffee,"Just visited Group Therapy Coffee in Singapore and it was a sublime experience! The cafe exudes a warm and inviting ambiance. The staff were attentive and friendly. As for the coffee, it was simply outstanding - rich and smooth. Their breakfast menu is also worth a try, especially the pancake stack. The place was buzzing but still maintained a laid-back vibe. It's tucked away on the second floor, making it a tranquil escape from the city's hustle. All in all, a true gem for coffee lovers and breakfast enthusiasts. Can't wait to go back!"
Group Therapy Coffee,"Their service, setting and ambient are nice, I did have a pleasant and quiet sat morning until closer to 10am. Came here for their pancake and coffee but probably I came with hi expectation so didn't felt this will be my go to place. Their pancake definitely is above ave."
Group Therapy Coffee,"Decent brunch place with nice ambience.  Enjoyed the western breakfast - the portions were pretty decent, with great service, but the pasta was a little too salty and dry."
Group Therapy Coffee,Came here for there pulled pork burger. Have truffle fries sweet potato fries and normal fries. Typical cafe style cafe. A bit on the ex side think cos in CBD area.
Group Therapy Coffee,"If you're on the lookout for a breakfast spot  that serves up delicious salmon and egg on toast, this is definitely worth a visit! The interior decor of the restaurant is stylish yet comfortable, perfect for a catch-up session with friends. The food is well prepared with poached eggs that are perfectly cooked and served on a toast. The addition of smoked salmon makes the dish even more delightful. The flavours and textures of the ingredients are well balanced, and every bite is a delight. The coffee is particularly noteworthy, and the skilled baristas know how to whip up a mean latte or cappuccino. With its welcoming atmosphere and great coffee, it's the perfect place to start your day and enjoy a breakfast with friends. Highly recommended."
Group Therapy Coffee,"Repeat customer for many times. The food here is reasonably priced and solidly executed consistently. Highly recommend the skinny egg ben, it costs the same or cheaper than other cafes, but very generous with ingredients like avocado and smoked salmon. Super satisfying meal everytime"
Group Therapy Coffee,"It’s been awhile since I’ve popped by this cafe. The food is not bad but honestly nothing to shout about.  It used to be more crowded but surprisingly, even on a weekend, we were able to walk in and there were available tables.  The salmon eggs ben was good, decent-sized portion. The croque madam was very dry. We didn’t like it. Juices were freshly squeezed !"
Group Therapy Coffee,"Best brunch in Katong, huge portions, quality ingredients and thoughtful preparation. While pricey (about 50 for 2 with drinks), it was well worth it. However certain parts of the cafe (near the air circulation pipes, toward the inner part) are slightly noisy and air con is not strong there."
Group Therapy Coffee,Friendly accomodating staff and great atmosphere that reminds me of my time in Australian cafes. Good quality food and coffee at affordable prices. Would return! Truffle fries and burgers are tasty and pasta is similar to those in higher end Italian restaurants. Looking forward to my next visit!
Group Therapy Coffee,"I recently had the pleasure of dining at this fantastic spot, and it truly delivered on both food and vibes. The menu offered a delightful selection of dishes that were both flavorful and satisfying. The portions were generous, leaving me fully satisfied without feeling overwhelmed. The ambiance was warm and inviting, creating a relaxed atmosphere that made me feel right at home. Whether you're looking for a cozy dinner or a casual gathering with friends, this place ticks all the boxes. Good food, good vibes, and perfect portion sizes—what more could you ask for?"
Tolido's Espresso Nook,"Let me tell you, I enjoyed this brunch so much to the point that I think I can brunch there every week for the rest of my life and not get bored.  It has a very trendy interior, and the waiters are very helpful and friendly. We got the truffle scrambled eggs and the prawn and scallop special scrambled eggs. The eggs was creamy, perfectly cooked and the combination of truffle on one dish and mixed seafood on the other was like an explosion of flavor in my mouth, simply amazing.  For dessert, we got the pandan cakes and ice blended salted caramel latte and ice blended mocha, which is the restaurant's signature and it was the best ice blended drink I ever tried. It was creamy, rich in flavors and just satisfies your taste buds  The prices are reasonable, especially for the service and the quality of the ingredients used, maybe I will be back one day"
Tolido's Espresso Nook,"Small serving western style foods. Limited choice on the menu. Always crowed, and need to be cheque up to 20 - 40.min for a table /seat. Some time you get seat very fast, if you didn't preference for waiting a seat in door. Thia cafe don't accept Cash payment. Using scan for ordering / credit card payment acceptable. Was here just for a coffee break with a croissant. 2.5/5 black coffee - taste more soury. Serve with plain water. 2.5/5 almond croissant - the croissant is the type with cake texture (mix together) so... It abit saggy / soft, not the Crunchy type. I still prefer without the cake texture and the type pastry (千层酥）with very Crunchy one."
Tolido's Espresso Nook,"Been here 3 timesss and always for the damn super nice potato :potato: rosti!!! Best rosti I ever had in SG in my opinion!! Ordered the regular rosti set and you can taste the original flavour of potato fried to perfection! Truffle rosti is my favourite, you can try if you dont mind the strong truffle flavour (might be too overpowering). Besides, I've tried the beef stew which is nice but not outstanding, I suggest you can give the stout-glazed bacon french toast a try, quite nice but kinda sweet to me. I will go back for rosti and probably try their pasta next time! p.s. do not suggest ordering scramble egg on top of your order, very normal and small in portion for a $fiver $"
Tolido's Espresso Nook,"Wonderful lunch location for the weekend - very popular and had to queue for some time. Good food, nice ambience, tasty ice blended coffees…what more to ask for? :)"
Tolido's Espresso Nook,"(Detailed review below) Food :star::star::star::star::star: Atmosphere :star::star::star::star::star: Accessibility :star::star::star::star: Cost :star::star::star::star: Service :star::star::star::star::star:  Was recommended this place by a friend with a warning to expect long queues! Luckily for me, there were no queues and I suspect that turning up an hour before closing time helped! :grinning_face_with_sweat:  We had the laksa pasta and the stout glazed French toast with bacon and both were nice. The laksa could be better (IMHO but I'm probably picky). The French toast was truly outstanding; fluffy toast with just the right amount of sweetness.  I was told later that I should try the waffles so that's definitely on my hit list for my next visit! Thanks folks for a lovely meal in a nice casual vibes cafe!"
The Populus,"The ambience is something you would appreciate while having your meal here. The service staff is very helpful and friendly. One thing I didn't enjoy is their Scrambled Egg, it lacks of flavor and find it a bit to dry in the centre. Their filter coffee was actually good"
The Populus,"This is a really popular cafe and it’s better to make a reservation rather than walk in.  The Populus French Toast was not bad, not too sweet and the toast was quite fluffy. The Strawberry & Elderflower Sundae with Waffle looks impressive but melts fast. The waffle was quite crispy even with the ice cream on top. The Maple Butter Tater Tots is super addictive, especially if you are dining with kids. It is a must try!"
The Populus,"The restaurant served delicious food and had an inviting ambience. The dishes I tried includes spring onion pancake with fried chicken and the strawberry waffle. The staff were prompt and helpful. The ambience felt nice to be in while enjoying the meal. The price was really steep, but worth the rare visits to the area."
The Populus,"Hearty brunch- the Populous Scramble had a generous serving of egg and bacon. For a lighter meal, the halibut fish with soba has a unique tangy taste unlike the usual soba. I liked it personally. Visited during the off peak hour in the late afternoon. Nice cafe with good ambience."
The Populus,"food is good, but a bit pricey. the buckwheat pancake is thick, savoury and slightly sweet at the same time. very interesting pancake. kinda remind me of a dense cake. everythg went well together, the fruits, the syrup, the crumbs. both of us finished it. however, i do not recommend this as a dessert. too heavy. Its more like a meal. I love the ambience and the staff are quite attentive. there is a dining time limit here, so it feels kinda rush towards the end."
P.S. Cafe,"The atmosphere at PS CAFE is undeniably great and fantastic, always transporting you to a different world with its modern and relaxed vibe. However, I must express my disappointment in the significant drop in their food quality and service standards, especially considering the price point.  The truffle oil in their truffle fries has noticeably decreased, and the food consistently arrives lukewarm :melting_face:Whether it's the breakfast set, roast chicken, or pasta, it feels like they have been sitting in the kitchen for some time before being served.  While some of the service staff are new and genuinely try their best, it's the manager who seems to lack leadership and poses a problem. For instance, upon arriving at 8 pm, he greeted us with the question, ""Table for 2, here for dinner right?"" It's disheartening to receive such a poorly executed welcome conversation, as it sets a negative tone for the entire dining experience.  To make matters worse, when his staff came to the table to surprise my friend with a birthday cake, the manager approached us at the exact same moment to ask for payment. I found myself torn between paying the manager on my left or singing the birthday song and celebrating my friend's special moment on my right. Eventually, I paid first and requested that they prioritize and handle one task at a time in the future.  I have been a patron of PS CAFE since 2013, dating back a decade at Harding Road outlet. It's a brand I have always admired, but I understand that the F&B industry faces challenges in terms of manpower. I sincerely hope that they can address and resolve these issues soon. However, based on my recent 2 experiences, I can only give a one-star rating :/"
P.S. Cafe,"Location & vibes score for this centrally located P.S. outlet right in Raffles City, on top of the MRT.  Ambience is so great for a bustling shopping mall. Great place to meet and chill with friends on a weekday afternoon.  Reservations always advised, so no wait and asked for a balcony table. What a treat.  Food and drinks are standard P.S. fare. We all had soda coolers ( all good but no pix taken) I think I remembered truffle fries to be better here.  Lovely wait staff, efficient, not overly friendly. Best of all discreet and ask nicely when they need the table for a coming dinner time reservation.  Recommend and definitely coming back!"
P.S. Cafe,"My go-to for a quick lunch whenever I’m in Raffles City. The Thai Beef Salad is a winner. Love the atmosphere of this cafe best. Relaxed, modern and you’ll forget that you’re in the middle of a shopping mall. Service is friendly too."
P.S. Cafe,"Located at the top floor of Raffles City Shopping Centre, situated as a stand-alone F&B kiosk far away from any other restaurants. Compared to the hustle and bustle of the basement food outlets, I found this to be rather serene and peaceful. Definitely come here if you want to have a good catch-up with your friends, and not be asking “huh what did you say” due to noise pollution.  Food wise- I was a little disappointed to be honest. The mains do not come cheap, yet they barely satisfied in terms of taste. The prawn pasta we got was way too salty (like I bit a chunk of himalayan rock salt)  and the truffle fries did not live up to the sky high expectations trusted upon it. Perhaps I was setting myself up for disappointment, but the truffle taste was not strong. The roast chicken was decent- get that if you are here.  Service was good but I wished the waiters would be more attentive with refilling our waters, instead of having to wave them down to get a refill every time.  That being said, we came here on a Sunday around 1.30pm, without a reservation, so I suppose a reservation is not always needed. Waiters and managers were efficient, and food came out promptly."
P.S. Cafe,"Enjoyed the truffle fries, roast chicken, and dessert is a must!  Good location for gathering.  Everything is well thought of.  No wonder they have so many branches in SG."
P.S. Cafe,"A wonderful dining experience with my family! The coffee latte was excellent, with just the right balance of flavors. The club sandwich was top-notch, featuring delicious toasted bread and fresh ingredients, accompanied by delightful salads. The staff was incredibly friendly, especially towards my child. We thoroughly enjoyed our time here and will undoubtedly return in the future. Highly recommended!"
P.S. Cafe,"My second visit. A classic location for brunch and dinner. Excellent selection of food and drink with creative twists. A must visit when coming to Paragon. Service can be a tad slow when crowded, so would be great to come during down time. Highly recommended."
P.S. Cafe,"Nothing amazing, food is alright but very pricey. Our truffle fries didn’t have the taste or smell of truffle, though I smelt it from another table who ordered it too. Barramundi is not bad."
P.S. Cafe,"The vibe was good and staff were friendly. There’s many options on the menu but not much choices for the main course as there’s only burgers, beef steak and fish and chips,  that would be great if there are pork or lamb dishes.  The sandwich was not bad, the bread was soft, fluffy and I like the salad. The portion was big enough for dinner and I was so stuffed with it."
P.S. Cafe,"The menu is pretty limited. I generally feel the place and food are more associated with branding of the Cafe, a place to be seen instead of for the goodness and ambience."
P.S. Cafe,"We had fantastic truffle fries, fish and chips and roasted chicken. All of the dishes were great but the chicken was the star. Unfortunately, the portions were so big that we were unable to eat any of the delicious looking cake. But it is a reason to come back. Thank you for a nice evening with great food and service!"
P.S. Cafe,"Great ambiance, nice food! Portion is considered big. Can tell that their truffle fries is a must as every table has one of it :thumbs_up_light_skin_tone:"
P.S. Cafe,"Had dinner here on a weekend night. Wonderful server and service by the crew. Ordered their famous truffle fries (sharing portion) I can confirm that this is the BEST truffle fries in Singapore. Portion is great, covered with heaps of parmesan and drenched in truffle oil. Simply delightful:red_heart:  For mains we ordered their prawn aglio olio. Sadly it was just ok, nothing exceptional.  At the recommendation of the FOH, we ordered sticky date pudding and another desert which isn't on the menu (forgot the name). Sticky date pudding is very sweet so if u are a sweet tooth, u will enjoy it. The burnt caramel sauce engulfing the pudding was really nice though.  The other desert was a surprisingly sweet surprise. Vanilla ice cream sandwiched by choux pastry(maybe?), doused with chocolate sauce and sprinkled with almond flakes. Total of 5pcs of the marvelous creation in one portion. You might want to try this instead of a regular cake if ure here for a bday celebration!"
P.S. Cafe,"Nice ambience with great service. The food was good, recommend the truffle fries for sharing. Do remember to make a reservation."
P.S. Cafe,"The place design is nice, and staffs are also friendly. I love the generous portion of truffle fries, we could not finish it with two people. Hahaha, anyway the food quality still got some room for improvement. Overall, it's a good place for dating as well."
P.S. Cafe,"PS cafe is crowded as usual and the atmosphere is great. I had the PS Burger - medium rare. It is nice but I would not rate it as the best burger. The meat is juicy but some part is little firm, prefer it to be more tender. The fries is good for sure and very crispy.  The red velvet cake with Ice cream and eclair are ok. The cake is moist and not too sweet. Great for sharing since it is huge. The eclair is large and looks pretty. It is not too sweet and worth a try if you still have space in your stomach:winking_face:"
P.S. Cafe,This is ecstatically the best looking amongst the PS Cafes.  They have a good selection of food and beverages that some might consider pricey. But their cakes and deserts are very good.  It’s a great place to chill in the afternoons and also good for sundowners after a long day.  It’s always a pleasure to come here. But take note they get busy during lunch times.
P.S. Cafe,"Perfect place with a beautiful backyard view but it’s oh so crowded on weekends.  As with all PS cafes, we have to make reservations prior to coming down. But however, as the place was so busy during tea time, the staff is just so loaded that everybody queue in one queue irregardless of whether you made a reservation or not.  On the Sunday which I came, we waited for approx 15minutes before we were seated. We were seated just near the cakes display (yum!) and we could see the beautiful natural forage/forest just outside. We were kind of thankful that we weren’t seated outside as the weather was quite hot that day.  We ordered a seafood basket, truffle fries, and an all day breakfast with 2 iced chocolate. We weren’t too impressed with the ice chocolate as it was very diluted and was tasteless. The all day breakfast was very loaded with ingredients, and the sausage and bacon was cooked just right. The seafood basket was fried just right and the batter was crispy. Only feedback is some of the squid tasted quite stale and had a strong freezer taste. The truffle fries was as usual wonderful.  Service was good, but only with the right staff. We were lucky we got one of the more experienced lady supervisor or manager to serve us. She knew what we wanted with one small signal, and was good for a quick chat and very prompt with her service.  We will definitely be back! Thank you."
P.S. Cafe,"A cozy little cafe hidden away behind a few trees in the Dempsey Hill area. The food here is a bit pricey, but so is everything else in the area. The staff are friendly and the food comes out relatively quick. Taste-wise, the food is above average but you're really paying for the setting and ambience. It's quite a comfortable feeling to be eating inside a grassy and wooded area; and even if you're indoors, there is floor to ground glass windows that let you see the surroundings. Coffee here wasn't too bad though."
P.S. Cafe,"Have been coming here for years. The food is always good and you can’t beat the jungle location and beautiful interior. Service is capable and the food is always good, whether breakfast or lunch. The cakes are also proper."
P.S. Cafe,"PS Cafe at One Fullerton serves an exceptional Sticky Toffee Pudding that left me delighted and satisfied. Here are the highlights of my experience:  Irresistible Taste: The Sticky Toffee Pudding is an absolute delight for dessert lovers. The cake is moist, rich, and perfectly balanced with a luscious toffee sauce. Every bite was a heavenly treat.  Cozy Atmosphere: PS Cafe at One Fullerton offers a warm and inviting ambiance that enhances the dining experience. The comfortable seating and charming decor create a pleasant and relaxed environment.  Attentive Service: The staff at PS Cafe were attentive, friendly, and knowledgeable. They provided excellent recommendations and ensured that my dining experience was enjoyable from start to finish.  Beautiful Location: PS Cafe at One Fullerton is situated in a picturesque location with stunning waterfront views. It's the perfect spot to enjoy a delicious dessert while taking in the breathtaking scenery.  Overall, PS Cafe's Sticky Toffee Pudding at One Fullerton is a must-try dessert. The combination of flavors, cozy atmosphere, and attentive service make it a wonderful dining destination. I highly recommend indulging in this delectable treat."
P.S. Cafe,Really friendly service. Accommodating to questions regarding food. Suitable food for children.  Was a really tasty meal. Everyone enjoyed it. Against a nice setting. Definitely recommend and good for those looking for variety against Western and local food options.
P.S. Cafe,"I'll rate this a 5 Star on every aspect of the experience. PS Cafe anyway is a great place to go blindly for a brunch. But this location is just amazing! Right on the waterfront above the Merlion, it has a great vibe.  Staff is very courteous, service is prompt and makes you comfortable. But the food is just brilliant. I loved the eggs Florentine, the salmon royale, avocado eggs and the Citrus sunset drink. Coffee is great too!"
P.S. Cafe,"Food here was better than the raffles city outlet.  - truffle fries, da bomb. Must order, we ordered 2 servings - tiger prawn agio had ample amount of garlic hidden below the generous serving of pasta - burger was slightly dry but I attribute it to  medium well, prefer to go for medium next time"
P.S. Cafe,"A very good place to hang out with friend, but honestly I might not want to order the salad again, it’s quite boring, should have try the steak sandwich, will do it next time. The outdoor view is definitely the best, staff is so nice to give a birthday decor on the orange cake. Love the experience. Best place to skate."
P.S. Cafe,"Second visit to PS Cafe. Great ambience for a nice family dinner, always wow guests I bring. Food is great and generous portions hence be careful on over ordering. But more importantly the staff makes you feel welcome and is very attentive. Won't hesitate to return again"
P.S. Cafe,"This is my 2nd visit to PS cafe, first visit was to Paragon’s outlet a few years back. Love the place, ambiance, food and service. Hence, thought of introducing my friend to another outlet. However it was slightly disappointing.  Menu selection - 6/10 We were greeted with 2 mains from the menu being unavailable as well as 1 of the mains from the daily specials. Which gave us about 5/6 mains to choose from.  Service - 10/10 Service staff were prompt and polite. Efficiently with refilling our waters too. :thumbs_up_light_skin_tone:  Food We started off with truffle fries - 8/10. Truffle flavor is not over powering unlike some places :nauseated_face:Eleanor was kind enough to suggest a “half portion” as we had other food as well. Thank you Eleanor :star-struck:  We had the seafood basket as well - 7/10. Tasted lovely but price point is slightly on the higher side for the amount.  Daily special pork chop - 2/10 :cross_mark::cross_mark::cross_mark::cross_mark: Firstly price point, it’s $44. I was expecting something amazing as $44 for pork chop is not cheap. Hence, I had high expectations to begin with. However, I was confused with the combination. Apple, squash, pork chop. Pork chop was tough and dry :crying_face:. Expected it to be a little moist, but it was dry throughout. That made every bite difficult.  The mains was something I was looking forward to, but this visit was overly disappointing…"
P.S. Cafe,"Staffs are friendly and helpful! Service is superb! Overall the food, environment and service are excellent! This are our 2nd time visit. Definitely will be back again!"
P.S. Cafe,Birthday lunch with friends. The food portion very big can order can share. Love the mushroom soup. I had the prawn pasta hmm so so only not very flavourful. Staff is very very friendly and helpful
P.S. Cafe,"Good food, great service as always with PS Cafe. The mac and cheese was quite underwhelming though. The good thing is that they do their scrambled eggs well."
P.S. Cafe,"This is the ever classic cafe with huge food portion, high standard quality good feast, great coffee, excellent ambience and friendly staff who will cater to all your needs. Strong aircon and very comfortable chairs with big tables and ample space to put your laptop and a chill place to chit chat for a long time. :smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes:"
P.S. Cafe,"The quality of food is fresh, server is attentive and friendly. She even asked if we have any food allergies during order. Just a little noisy with kids screaming out their lungs for a few times which does irritates quite a bit."
P.S. Cafe,Weekend dinner almost full house. About 15min waiting time for a table. Food consistently good as usual. Mushroom soup thick and creamy. Brownie rich and sticky. Looks good tastes better.
P.S. Cafe,"Service was outstanding and portions are generous. The lovely Indah who took care of our table had a warm smile and made our dining experience very comfortable and seamless. We dined here when they had the Christmas menu and I was surprised by how big the turkey Caesar salad was because it was a starter! Could easily share between two people. Dessert is always a highlight for me at PS Cafe, I’ve always enjoyed their sticky date pudding which is super moist and decadent. Their Christmas special had brandy in the butterscotch. Not from the Christmas menu, their all-time best seller Chocolate cake is MASSIVE! Super moist and the chocolate sauce is sinfully good. Super full by the end of dinner!!"
P.S. Cafe,"Lovely outlet, came here for brunch, enjoyed the big breakfast and coffee among other food ordered! Good service!"
P.S. Cafe,"1st time visiting this branch. Ordered truffle fries, 4 mains and 2 desserts to share. Overall, food is nice, ambience is nice too. Standard for sticky date pudding drops a bit, but still quite nice. Only funny thing is payment is via QR code, while ordering is via the servers. If you driving, can park at Car park D5, free parking."
P.S. Cafe,Went with hubby on a Friday night. Ordered portobello chips which was absolutely delicious. Hubby and I ate barramundi and we definitely did not regret ordering that. It was really very good. Nice to sit outdoors but do have a mosquito repellent handy. Wait staff not too impressive but the manager/ supervisor who showed us to our table was friendly and efficient.
P.S. Cafe,"Food was fine, not spectacular. The prices were actually more spectacular! One slice of cake for $18! One slice, not one whole cake! :face_with_tears_of_joy: The BBQ ribs were good though. Must try!  Kudos to the service staff Joel, for being very helpful and friendly."
P.S. Cafe,"Good place to rest and dine along East Coast Park. Nice ambience and service was good. Staffs were helpful and polite.  First time dinning at PS cafe. Laksa was creamy and tasty but truffle shoestring fries was okay. Heard so much rave about the truffle fries so was maybe expecting it to be super tasty.  Still in general, was happy with my experience here. Menu is on the pricier side, will return again.  :thumbs_up::thumbs_up:"
P.S. Cafe,"While the venue is definitely a bit more stand out compared to its other venues, surrounded by nice greenery and a view of the beach, I wouldn’t say the food was on par. We tried the chicken wings, which were a solid ok, and the seafood risotto was tasty without tasting super fresh, the octopus was overly sweet and a bit overpoweringly icky after a while. But if you’re just looking to chill and soak in the beach vibes, it’ll do, but just don’t expect the food to be as amazing as it’s other outlets."
P.S. Cafe,"Food is pretty good- usual  PSCafe standard. Service can be improved in their attentiveness. We had to get the attention of the waitresses a few times for water refills. Atmosphere is quite nice but a little warm for me. We had spicy prawn aglio olio, steak sandwich - rare and medium but it came more medium than rare. Salad was good. Truffle fries and normal fries not much difference. Cannot taste the truffle. Fish and chips is good."
P.S. Cafe,Service is good. Please make reservations as the place was almost empty but we gotta wait for 30min before someone cancelled their reservation. The food is good.
P.S. Cafe,"One of my favorite place to get some dessert. They have outdoor area where you can bring along your favorite dog. But its confusing because sometimes  I can use main entrance and sometime staff asked you to bring dog from outside entrance even though I put the dog inside the stroller and fully cover. It’s inconvenient since there is a stairs and hard to bring up the stroller. However foods is good. The ambiance’s is nice, I love their music playlist is goes with the vibes."
P.S. Cafe,"PS. cafe has been around for a while now but the pricing can be quite steep if you’re just looking for a simple meal at a cafe. Quality of the food is still good though. I had the club sandwich and it was very delicious, especially the tomato relish on the side. My friends had the breakfast plate, which they enjoyed as well. Was very tempted to get the truffle fries but at $17 for a portion, we decided to give it a miss. But if there’s a bigger group and more chip in for the side, it is worth it.  P.S. doesn’t disappoint."
P.S. Cafe,"One of the PS cafe that I love to enjoy a lazy afternoon with my furkids. The service was great and attentive, the staffs provides ice cold water serves in a dog bowl to my furkids. The outdoor seating is surprisingly quite cooling."
P.S. Cafe,"Weird concept of takeaways in a dining in cafe. Toilet stinks, stinky fumes lingered around the seats near the toilet. Food is bad. Ugly chicken wings is indeed ugly and tasteless. Quality of food definitely not worth the price. Service staff is good though. Just scrolling through the reviews and noted the copy and paste response. Might as well don’t respond or better off using ChatGPT."
P.S. Cafe,"Love this place. Small and cozy, they don't call it ""petit"" for nothing. Food, desserts, and drinks are fantastic. Great selections of wines too. Best of all, the staff is friendly and attentive (someone please give him a raise!)"
P.S. Cafe,"Chic, fashionable, yet cozy. The gentleman behind the counter was friendlier than anyone I encountered on our trek to Tiong Bahru! I ordered an iced tea at 5:30pm realizing only after the first sip it was caffeinated. He was kind enough to brew me a lemongrass herbal tea and put it over ice for me instead while I waited for my insanely delicious impossible meatball pizza... We couldn't resist having a slice while we waited for our grab home."
P.S. Cafe,"Very courteous staff. Beautiful decor. Lots of bottles of wine and champagne to buy and drink on the spot or take home. Speaking of take home, all food ordered here comes in to go boxes but you can eat it on the premises. Same goes for the coffee. It's a bit quirky but apparently it's a neighborhood licensing issue. But the ambience makes up for it. Be sure to admire the huge slices of cake on display and if you're feeling like splurging (those are per slice prices) I'm sure they are delicious."
P.S. Cafe,"Second time there in  two months.  First was brunch and  Burger was especially good.  The second time was for Cakes and coffee.  Cakes are priced  $17-20,  much higher then  else where.  Even for dine in,  disposables cups and pack away boxes  were used."
Wildseed Café & Bar at The Summerhouse4,"Nice-looking and great design restaurant. They offer both indoor with aircon and outdoor seats which is really good for us to choose depending on weather condition. The food is awesome also. A bit pricey I would say. Also the location is quite isolated and far from my house. If you want to escape from the city, it’s a great choice for me. Highly recommended."
Wildseed Café & Bar at The Summerhouse4,Love the ambience and coziness of the place! Truly a place to get away from the hustle & bustle of city life. What's more...? They are Pet-Friendly!!!  Plus the food quality was great! Tasty and the portion was good.
Wildseed Café & Bar at The Summerhouse4,"If you plan for a special occasion or wish to have a good time, please don’t visit this cafe. First impression all was okay, nice ambience and everything. Subsequently when the food came, we saw that some of the cutleries were all stained with food or dirt (Provided pictorial proof). We ordered a mix to share and the pasta came not only cold, but the texture of the linguine was so tough (i know linguine is meant to be served abit less well done, but the linguine we tasted was horrible - tough and cold). The rest of the food was nothing much special, you can definitely get better cafe food elsewhere with a better price point (all of these cost around $30/dish)."
Wildseed Café & Bar at The Summerhouse4,"They utilize a self-help QR code system for ordering and payment before the food is served. The doughy smoked pork pizza was enjoyable, but I found the toppings to be lacking. The beef burger had a soft bun and well-seasoned meat, which was quite delicious. We also have to help ourselves to water and condiments. Overall, I did find the service to be slow, which may be something to consider during a visit."
Wildseed Café & Bar at The Summerhouse4,"Taste of the food is great! Not too salty but able to bring out the flavor of the food. Portion is just nice, for small eaters can share and try many type of the dishes here. Love the atmosphere, great for gals chat, bdae celebration, nice evening or lunch with love ones!"
Common Man Stan,"One of the best breakfast I’ve ever had! The umami avocado toast was so full of flavour and so tasty.  Really nice looking cafe, with prompt and professional service. We were seated at the bar and had our water topped up fast.  However, the food is quite pricey, especially the coffee is very expensive, we ordered the white coffee- it was okay but not the best Coffee I’ve had."
Common Man Stan,What a great coffee place in the CBD. This place has transformed itself since when I was working in this area. I had a filtered slow brew beans from Ecuador. Love the textile and the mild and smooth finishing. Food was also lovely. The Turkish common breakfast was excellent. It’s a vegan selection yet is was so delicious. The peta bread certainly goes well the this hummus.
Common Man Stan,"From the commonman coffee family so it's all good. Great place for small casual business meetings or if you're looking for a place in the CBD to chill and kill time.  They have more seating deeper inside the shop than you can see while standing at the door. Unfortunately, if you're alone you'll probably get the bar seats or something outside. Either way, nice place with nice coffee."
Common Man Stan,Great brunch place with decent options. Slightly pricey but expected for its location.  Coffee was great. We had umami mushroom toast and croque monsieur and they were also great.  Small comment: the staff are not proactive to deter people smoking outside near their guests.
Common Man Stan,We enjoyed every dish especially the chicken. So crispy and well-spiced. Their flat bread was also very fluffy. Staffs were attentive and friendly. Nice atmosphere!
Bearded Bella,"Recommended Bearded Bella by a local friend. And we were not disappointed. The menu is very appealing. Prices are fair. The food seems fresh and of high quality.  Food must be ordered through an online app and is delivered to the table pretty quickly. The kitchen is visible from the cafe. There are lots of pets outside, so it's a great place to bring your furry friends too.  Our server was very friendly. Kudos to him.  Highly recommend Bearded Bella for a late morning coffee or brunch. The fact that the place was busy on a weekday speaks volumes. We will be back again soon."
Bearded Bella,"Went last Tuesday morning after making a reservation online.  Then they Whatsapp me a day earlier to reconfirm my booking so good system! The place is cosy, the young servers are friendly and efficient. Not a coffee-drinker but my friend is and she said that the coffee is :thumbs_up::grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes: Food-wise, the portions are huge and I love it that they gave us so much fresh greens on our plates :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing: Food was done well in my opinion, some other cafes will charge you about the same and give you poorly cooked breakfast dishes.  So good job to the chefs there, please continue with the good standard! Will return another time."
Bearded Bella,"Simply love the chillax vibes of the place where my fur and I have all the space around us for a relaxing dinner and entertained by the bubbly lively sound effects from the bars next doors. Also enjoyed the cafe food with a creative twist, refreshing cheeky gin-based drinks at all night HH price, and earnest and efficient service."
Bearded Bella,Had the salmon with rosti bowl. Was so so good! Coffee is ok. Nice place with big tables. Internet is annoying as it logs u out every 30 minutes. The place also gets a bit loud later in the day
Bearded Bella,"Place was cosy and pack on a Sunday during lunch time. The Grilled Cheese and Prosciutto sandwich was really good as it had that sweet and salty flavor combined into one! Although I find the bowl of fries to be overprice considering it’s not much, I still wouldn’t mind coming back here for the mains!:smiling_face:"
Lad & Dad,"Not a huge fan of Fish & Chips but I enjoyed them here. Very little oil despite being deep fried. I love the fries! I love green peas and I find the mashed peas delicious and interesting! Beef stew was tender with the right amount of savoury, it went very well with the buttery mashed potato. Will be back for the other menu items."
Lad & Dad,Repeated return for their fish n chips! Managed to try other dishes this time and loved the scotch eggs and bangers & mash. The prawns were huge but personally prefer if non-frozen prawns were used because of the texture. Overall still my go-to place for fresh fish n chips!
Lad & Dad,"Value for money, authentic fish and chips with nice haddock. Batter is light, crisp and not too thick, though wished the oil tasted 'cleaner'. Had the scampi and chips as well. Scotch eggs were alright, onion rings not so impressive. Opening hours for food 12-2.30pm, 5.30-9pm. Bar opens 12-10pm. Compulsory for each patron to either order a main or a drink."
Lad & Dad,Nice open air pub ambiance. I'm no Brit but the fish and chips were spot on. Crazy crispy crunchy batter with zero sign of oil anywhere. Same with the fries.  Great HH beer price and I highly recommend the London pale ale. Perfectly light and dry for the fish and chips.
Lad & Dad,"Super helpful service staff to accommodate our large group of over 10pax although a very tight and small dining space. Food was fantastic as usual, love love love the fish & chips and pigs in blanket! A larger area to dine at at their tanglin outlet but great food regardless which outlet. 100% recommend!"
The Garden Slug,"Has been here a couple of times. The furry friends love it. Very pet friendly and they offer water dishes to every :dog_face:. Quite a fair bit of puppy menu to choose and in this occasion we had the vegan pancakes for the pup. The food wasn't great to be honest, but again we come here for the furry friends and they sure enjoyed themselves"
The Garden Slug,Great food in Telok kurau. I first had garden slug more than 10 years ago  and decided to return after a long while. The food was great and the drinks were good! Definitely a good find for people living in the east coast area.
The Garden Slug,"Quaint little cafe tucked in a quiet corner. Pets friendly so if you are lucky, you’ll see some furry friends around. Nice ambience, great selection of food from appetisers to mains and pasta. Highly recommend a visit if you are in the area."
The Garden Slug,Cozy little cafe hidden along telok kurau rd. Service was excellent when I arrived told them my dog was thirsty and was immediately served a bowl of ice water for my dog. Staff were really polite and friendly. There were other patrons there who brought their dogs too which were all friendly and allowed my dog to interact with them. Food gave off homely vibes. Portion was decent.  Overall my experience there was lovely.
The Garden Slug,"Laksa seafood - very average only. Cannot say tasteless, but just not salty, looks like Laksa, not taste like Laksa.  Seabass with black rice - please expect you will be having a very very sweet meals. Tomato paste + capsicum + onion , all mix together like a bowl of dessert rice.  Overall, average food. Consider ok. Dine here with low expectation; food might turns good :winking_face:"
The Garden Slug,"Food was quite good. If only their service was as good as their food. There's an indoor eating area with 5 tables. However, upon arrival, 2 tables were used by the young man and his girlfriend while his friend sat on another table working on his notebook. It may be a good idea to ""scan QR code and order"" but this allows the lack of the human touch. You open the cafe in the middle of a neighborhood but no one, both server and chefs, carries a smile. I don't think I'll visit it again."
The Garden Slug,"we decided to come here for a nice dinner with our pet! we had their ham and cheese set, nachos, lemon lime soda and omelette set. the bread was quite sense, almost like cake, which was quite nice. (we would have enjoyed it more if it was toasted to be more crispy) there was a generous amount of cheese, and the ham was one of those more 'atas' / fancy kind. the salad with lettuce and capsicum was delicious with some kind of sauce. the omelette was creamy and filled with peppery capsicum and mushrooms. the nachos were slightly soggy, but had a generous topping of black beans, tomato and beef. their lemon lime soda was nice as well. the atmosphere was cozy and the staff were very nice  and friendly. we would definitely come back for more!"
The Garden Slug,two best thing about tis place: 1.pets friendly(they will offer free cream to your dog). 2. portion is huge. their big breakfast is the biggest i ever seen in Singapore. more than enough for 2 adults to share. brioche is nice. but salad can give more rocket instead of lettuce pls?
The Garden Slug,"Itz a pet friendly cafe. Only 1 server n 1 cook on a weekday. The menu has unique naming of the dishes. Portion for pasta is generous. No ice water is served. After eating, very thirsty when got home."
The Garden Slug,"Ordered the all day breakfast eggs Benedict, seeing that it was a crowd favorite as listed in their menu. While the bread was soft and added the nice crunch for the eggs and the kale was ok, the eggs Benedict sauce was a bit too lemony for my liking. The consistency of the sauce was on point but the flavor was a bit off from the usual eggs Benedict that I had. A pity though, as the eggs were nicely poached and had a runny yolk centre. Price wise it was still ok. Small little cafe in the neighborhood.  Came back for another meal, and ordered green tea with milk and spicy spaghetti with white clams. Stood by my 3 star rating as the food was ok."
Oriole Coffee + Bar,"Another one of my The Entertainer tryouts. Loved that they had a good number of options for the 1-for1 deal (everything under ""Mains'). Went for the Sweet Soy Pork Rib and they were fall off the bone delicious. Loved that they were served with sweet potato fries too, added to the sweetness of the soy glaze. Also ordered the spicy calamari to try and the pickled chili pepper that it was served with had some kick to it. Overall definitely enjoyed and will return!"
Oriole Coffee + Bar,"Came on a relatively quiet weekend evening to refuel after a busy day at Orchard Road, and we were not disappointed. Ended up really full after dinner.  Came for the snapper fish and chips. Nicely fried batter with a hint of herbs, and soft moist fish inside.  Also tried the spicy sweet soy wings which was unexpectedly good - good enough to rival some Korean fried chicken stores! Well marinated, tender chicken that was crispy outside, and dripping with soy sauce with just a hint of spice. :face_savoring_food:"
Oriole Coffee + Bar,"Read from earlier reviews that service is good but there’s nothing about service since everything is via QR code. Was told to find menu and order thru QR code. But I saw that if is foreigners, paper menus was handed out to them. Foods taste average. For the price of $60 plus for a salad, main and drinks, can have it at other better places."
Oriole Coffee + Bar,"What enticed me to @oriolecoffee was their menu. They are a Coffee + Bar restaurant with a fairly sizeable menu and I like to have options. :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes:  :cut_of_meat: HERB RUB ONGLET STEAK Thick Skirt, Herb Rub, Grilled Romaine Lettuce, French Onion Sauce (complimentary glass of chardonnay) — Had it cooked medium! Honestly? This steak was so tender, savoury with a hint of sweetness from the sauce. So SOFT. Even the lettuce was extremely delicious. 𝐅𝐎𝐑 $𝟐𝟗, this was a score :hundred_points::leafy_green:  :fried_shrimp: SPAGHETTI AGLIO OLIO Tiger Prawns, Garlic, Chilli, Tomato, Arugula — You can customize the spice level :hot_pepper: (love that) We got spiciest, duh! Fat & juicy prawns my favourite. [$26]  :french_fries: TRUFFLE FRIES Nothing special, might be personal preference but I had better elsewhere. [$15]  :smiling_face_with_sunglasses: Might want to try their coffee and burgers (by BEDROCK) if you visit! My steak is a seasonal special so catch it before it’s gone! Happy hour available too. :wine_glass:  Had a pleasant time here, good service and food came fast. Nice place for gatherings and dates — Pan Pacific Service Suites Orchard first floor, next to 313 Somerset :smiling_face_with_hearts:  :heart_hands_light_skin_tone:Follow @onmineplate on Instagram for more foodie hunts!"
Oriole Coffee + Bar,"Haven’t been here in a long while, and happy to find that food is still good! Love that the fries still remain crispy even after we took our time to finish the mains.  Also value for money if you get Triple Plus membership! About $30 for fish tacos + burger!"
The Fabulous Baker Boy,Great tasting sandwiches. The sourdough bread used was awesome especially when paired with the soup. Serving size was larger than I expected which is always a good problem to have. I highly recommend this spot.
The Fabulous Baker Boy,Had lunch next door so we stepped in here for coffee and desserts. The cake was actually quite good! And the coffee was decent too. Place was nice and empty but i hope this isn't always the case!
The Fabulous Baker Boy,"It was not crowded when I visited but had to wait for about 10mins for my grilled beef sandwich. But, when it arrived, I wasn't disappointed. Delicious and very filling. Customers must be ready for the long-winded way to order online - download app, select restaurant, view menu and order, scan QR code, key in OTP. Servers served as IT rep to guide the ordering process haha. Appreciated the bottle of free water. The soups are great. Can taste fresh mushroom amd tomatoes. Will come again after pay day cos food is pricey."
The Fabulous Baker Boy,"The food and drinks are ok, but the vibe of the place is slightly off..  service felt indifferent and transactional. Overall, the place felt somewhat soul-less, for the lack of a better word.  Btw laksa pesto pasta is very spicy, do avoid if you can take spicy food, the qr core e-menu neglected to mention that.  The sourdough bread is fine, do give it a go."
The Fabulous Baker Boy,"This cafe is near Arab street and has an interesting selection of pastries. Their cake names are super interesting as well. We tried the Barack Obama cake, it was fresh not too dense nor too full of cream.  I would recommend this place!"
Wild Honey,"I had a wonderful birthday dinner here :smiling_face_with_hearts:. The space is cozy and spacious, the food is delicious and healthy (not too sweet, or too salty). Staff are enthusiastic and friendly. The restaurant also gave me a surprise when giving me a slice of birthday cake beautifully decorated with candle. :heart_hands_light_skin_tone: Thanks"
Wild Honey,"This is an all time favourite place of mine and I keep returning to Wild Honey for their amazing brunch food, good service and chill but fancy vibes. It’s a versatile place for both meeting friends to going out with a special someone. Really recommend the breakfast here especially the Turkish eggs. This time, we also tried the Moroccan which comes with mixed veggie fritters that were just perfectly crunchy and not too oily. The Thai milk tea is also quite unique and not too sharp."
Wild Honey,"Great atmosphere, service was quick and food was good. The Korean vegan salad was great, the coconut pancake was sweet but the mango was sour. The chocolate vegan cake was a little dry but still yummy."
Wild Honey,"A magnificent menu, creative presentation, delicious food and fantastic ambience. Jazzy seats with a nice view of the streets of Orchard road. There is nothing complain about this place and meal experience is soothing for a weekend brunch.  I tried the English which was just stunning. The Thai Iced Tea was served in a unique way and the service was just too notched.  Best place for all day breakfast and chill out with friends."
Wild Honey,"Visited here with colleagues. Nice ambience; we sat at the long table and we took our time, enjoying our meal slowly and chit chat. Food portion was big for my standard, luckily we were sharing. They were delicious - I especially liked the salad."
Wild Honey,"The location is nice. The food was good. It's delicious. I just find the bagel too hard and brioche having an old bread kind of taste. Their service was great. The serving size is big. For small eaters, 1 dish can be shared. Price is steep, considering the location. Spent 90$ for 2 meals with drinks. But kinda worth trying. Overall ok."
Wild Honey,"Just 15mins wait walk-in midday on a Sunday.  Impressive breakfast selections.   Good service.  Coffee was alright.  Food was ok.  Table was a bit awkward, a bar in front of knees,  can't really sit closer."
Wild Honey,"Super cute brunch spot with delicious food! Highly recommend booking a table, though we got there at opening and the staff were kind enough to squeeze us in! Lovely atmosphere and well worth a visit! Very generous portions though - if you aren’t big eaters, I would share!"
Wild Honey,"First time to Wild Honey. This one is on the third level of Scotts Square. Tried a main dish and some desserts. The Delancey beef pastrami was excellent, served with delicious poached egg. Desserts are good too. Served by friendly and helpful staff."
Wild Honey,"Ordered the Boulevard St Michel which had a spinach souffle that tasted very odd, with an unappetising texture. Got the English Breakfast too, which was nothing special. Overall, the ingredients didn’t taste fresh and flavours were not good. I can’t recommend this place. Spent $82 including 2 mediocre coffees."
Wild Honey,"I cannot say for sure that their pure honey sucks as they didn’t allow free tasting. But their sample bottle which they sold for $3.5 each, is highly diluted and is a waste of money. They are just tarnishing their own reputation. :thumbs_down:"
Wild Honey,"The price is a bit expensive, but the honey here is the real deal. My son, who was frail and weak, is now healthy with a spoonful of honey every day. It is completely different from cheap honey sold by mail order and the honey here is really worth it.  Thank you"
Wild Honey,"lousy drink, cant feel that it helps to ease my throat unlike my manuka honey which i eat regularly, didnt even allow me to return the bottle that is not being consumed and get refund"
Wild Honey,zzz
Wild Honey,"Fake honey, very diluted."
Dumpling Darlings,"The dumplings here are really unique, all types of dumplings from around the world! I recommend trying all their dumplings with the mixed platter where they have 3 of each of the 5 types of dumplings available. Despite dumplings being their specialty, the braised pork noodle is absolutely heavenly. The noodles are soft and springy, and the dish as a whole is flavourful. However, there aren’t many tables available and the outdoor seating is quite cramped."
Dumpling Darlings,"Upon entering, the space did not feel welcoming- it is dark, and different. The food was nice at first bite; but gradually it got too salty. Place seems to be more catered to expats, you could tell they wanted us (locals) out asap."
Dumpling Darlings,"Came here on  Sunday evening and was lucky to be able to get a seat promptly. Ordered the prawn & crab dumpling which was really good, the filling was fresh and delicious! The miso mushroom noodles and sichuan noodles were good too! Oh and the grapefruit thyme green tea is a must order! The service staff were also prompt and alert although we were seated outside."
Dumpling Darlings,"Love the vibe at this small, tight-seating restaurant. Wife and I are vegetarians and were pleased with the options available - we had the miso mushroom noodles, Impossible curry dumplings and veggie mandu, all of which were delicious. They were very generous with the ingredients (chives, mushrooms, seaweed) in the noodles. The yuzu osmanthus drink was also really good."
Dumpling Darlings,"The noodles and dumplings are delicious. The duck and original dumplings are tasty. Prawn & crab can be quite heavy taste and fresh if you like. Love the atmosphere, sat at the bar, lucky we could walk in during saturday without reservations for 2 pax."
Dumpling Darlings,Cosy little venue with a variety of dumplings to choose from. Really helpful staff that definitely helped us out as it was our first time having a team lunch here. I would say their original dumplings were good but their Momo's as well as the fried versions were excellent. Order them all and share :)
Dumpling Darlings,"Great food, great service. Unconventional yet tasty dumplings. We especially enjoyed the 'impossible' momo. Mushroom noodles very well-balanced and flavourful too. Can book ahead in the evening during busier times."
Dumpling Darlings,"Craving dumplings? Then you must visit Dumpling Darlings. At a highly affordable price you can stuff your face with delectable, thinly skinned, heavenly filled dumplings as well as homely noodle dishes. For 2, id recommend the dumpling party as well as pork noodles. My favourite dumplings: duck & impossible momos! Highly recommended and will surely be back for more!"
Dumpling Darlings,"A fun place to go to because you get to try different types of dumplings, which perhaps makes this a good place for dates too! If you have nothing to talk about, eat the dumplings and ask your date which one is his/her favourite. Food is pretty good and prices are reasonable for the location. The platter was a great option but would be better if it could include the other flavours as well (even if it costs more)."
Dumpling Darlings,All the dumplings here are awesome!  Deducting 1 star as the noodle is just average. Do not bother ordering any noodle dishes here.  Just go for the dumplings!
Suzuki Gourmet Coffee,The ambience and secluded location make it very appealing. The cafe and cuisine is based on japanese culture. I tried the houjicha latte for the first time. It was decent.  Would have preferred a better coffee mug than just paper cup
Suzuki Gourmet Coffee,"came in a rainy afternoon, not many customers due to the weather, great environment, quiet and peaceful surrounded by the aroma of fresh brewed coffee. Quite a variety of coffee beans, friendly staff introduced the area and some new machines. Ordered dripped Yemen mocha, love the mild sourness, dark roasted bitterness and sweet after taste.  Will definitely come back and visit again."
Suzuki Gourmet Coffee,"I think this will be a great place to chill and relax with your friends/lovers. The interior uses warm colors and feels very Japanese style.  I was quite surprised to see the cafe already had a swarm of customers in there although it is supposedly a weekday afternoon.  The menu seems to be quite limited and they only had some selections of baked pastries.  I ordered iced dirty matcha, it is quite bitter I would say but still drinkable. I spent an hour or two there before going off."
Suzuki Gourmet Coffee,Lovely environment to enjoy coffee with a calming environment. Might be a little noisy if crowded as expected. Definitely would want to come back again to try more drink and dessert in the future .  Mocha is chocolatey with a nice bitter end. Filter coffee is nice too.
Suzuki Gourmet Coffee,Was visiting my friend and was searching for a coffee space. The cafe setting is pleasant and a close resemblance to japan zen garden. It is packed around 3pm. Ordered a flat white and macha latte. Flat white is smooth and not overwhelming bitter. ice macha latte is a pretty green and thick with a mellow sweetness accompanying the macha slight pleasing bitterness. Will definitely come back again to try their pastries!
Sarnies,"Ordered the black pepper crab, hot honey wings and pork cotoletta. Food was fantastic although a steak knife to cut through the pork would have been superb. A wider selection of non-alcoholic drinks would be great too."
Sarnies,"Great little spot for healthy breakfast! Portion sizes were extremely generous, and very tasty. Halloumi bowl was a highlight. Coffee was also delicious. Popular spot, so go early on the weekends to beat the crowds."
Sarnies,"Cute place for brunch. Has indoors but we chose to sit outside! It was bustling during lunch hour on weekday! Food came in 5 minutes super fast. I enjoyed my salmon bagel and iced vanilla latte with oat milk! Overall good vibes, worth returning :thumbs_up_light_skin_tone: :red_heart: Follow @onmineplate on Instagram for more food hunts in Singapore"
Sarnies,Food was so bad. Steak and egg was the first we ordered. Steak was chewy and hard to swallow. Tasteless. So chewy that you can hardly finish biting to swallow because your jaw will be so sore FROM ALL TH CHEWING. Salmon and wrap was the second. I dont know if it's just me or why is the scrambled eggs hot and smoked salmon mixed wrapped together. Was it supposed to wrap both cold and hot food together ?  If u miss Malaysia's spearmint chewing gum you can just proceed to order the beef and flush ur mouth with iced lemon mint tea. There u go! Beef spearmint gum without breaking the law  We couldn't bring ourselves to finish it. Was just so bad. But staffs were friendly. Food sucks so bad.
Sarnies,"I used to be a regular here many years ago when I lived in the neighbourhood. Came again for a Sunday Brunch, seems the crowds have changed somewhat, and now has become a hangout for bikers who comes in big groups. The indoor tables tend to be empty as people prefer to sit outside. It was full. Ordered a banana pancake and a latte to dine in and a bacon and egg sandwich for takeaway. The portion is big, as I remembered it, and the food quality is delicious."
Earlybird,"Love that it’s not super crowded on a weekend. Plenty of seats around 11am, it got busier after 12 although there wasn’t a queue. They also serve free water so that’s a plus point!  Tried the fried chicken pancakes ($22) that I heard good reviews on, but sadly it wasn’t up to expectations. It was served very fast (within 5min), and portion was huge with 3 chicken tenders and 2 big pancakes. Taste wise, they soaked the entire plate with maple syrup, which was too much sugar and made the pancakes mushy as well. It would have been better if the syrup was served on the side instead. Chicken was well fried but was not at all spicy or seasoned. Generally a very average dish.  Tom yum prawn pasta ($21) came with a generous portion of prawns and also pretty spicy."
Earlybird,A quaint store with some spaces outdoor. Ordering required to be at the counter (very bar like). Chicken & Pancakes is excellent - well received by the team. I loved the spiced chicken (while it looks small) it’s quite filling. The food comes very quickly. If you are in the neighbourhood you can pop in and try the food.
Earlybird,"Very cosy vibe with decent selection of food and drinks. The dishes look very presentable and quite tasty. The drink list is intriguing and exciting. Totally worth trying out. Some form of self-service required, but the customer service is on point. Highly recommended for family and friend gatherings."
Earlybird,This is a great breakfast and lunch place close to Hotel Boss in Singapore.  I had the mushroom dish and it was loaded with mushrooms and everything was cooked to perfection. The coffee was excellent as well.  Great place if you are a digital nomad and want to get out of your hotel room and do some work in a great atmosphere. The fruit smoothies were very good too with no added syrups. Highly recommend this place.
Earlybird,Weekday morning not much crowd. Just a few tourists. Good ambience. Just came in for a drink and a dessert. Love the hot chocolate and tiramisu.
Knots Café,"I was impressed with the beauty of the decorations and designs of the restaurant, but even more so with the quality of the food.  The meats were juicy and tasty, portions were big.  Plants and flowers were all over the corners and walkways, just amazing!!"
Knots Café,"Nice decor with a lot of plants. Green with a garden vibe.  The food was okay. Nothing great but not bad at all. I figured people come here for the insta photos and not the food.  I ordered the beef Burger and the shrimps aglio olio with some green juice and affogato coffee on the side. Burger and drinks were good. Pasta was ordinary.  Overall spent $60, which I did not regret at all. But don't see myself coming back soon.  Oh also they don't not accept credit card or pay wave, which is really old considering the high price point"
Knots Café,Absolutely love the vibe in this cafe! The plants/home decor and high ceilings just makes me smile! The concept of allowing your diners to shop whilst waiting for their food to be served was just brilliant. Though was quite pricy for the location but will definitely visit again!
Knots Café,"Very cool to dine in a place like this. Food was okay. Passengers can alight directly at the door front. Unfortunately, it will be quite challenging for those that are on wheelchair to come to this restaurant."
Knots Café,"I like the place and the ambience. Food wise, I like my scramble eggs more creamy and runny on the inside. The tomato is sliced a little too thick for my liking."
Knots Café,"Great atmosphere, like the flowery decoration. Visited at dinner time and sadly the lamb was sold out. I ordered the pasta and it was average…probably below average considering how much it charges. The pasta was too creamy in the end that wasn’t delightful. You can register to their membership to get 5% discount. They didn’t charge on service and the staffs are friendly. Not water served without paying."
Knots Café,Price : $$ Ambience: 7/10 Value for money : below average  A unique place to hang out if its a lazy Sunday noon.  Conceptual of Cafe within a 'IKEA layout.  Food doesn't has much varieties. Pizza and lamb chops were nice and generous in proportion. Soup and pasta seems to be central kitchen standard and not worth at price tags.  Airflow seems to be stuffy with low air-conditioning settings.  A hard place to locate but good to venture it at least once in your life.
Knots Café,"Unique and cozy place to chill and chat with friends or family.  Really enjoyed the pasta, which was Al dente! Pizza was really good too, the egg really adds to the flavour.  The ambience of the cafe was industrial, but peaceful away from the bustle. Although quite difficult to get to via public transport, recommended to drive.  Service was good, and they even sell plants and knick knacks along with the food."
Knots Café,The food is average. Pasta is abit too creamy. the chicken chop is a bit tough. the chicken wing will be nicer if add a little bit more salt.  the coffee is nice. the tea average. the cakes are nice.
Knots Café,"Did not regret ordering lamb chop, taste was good. Matched well with house red wine. Love the truffle mushroom soup to the max."
Coffeeman coffee roasters,"Heard from friends about this place and happened to be in the area. Food:we ordered the common man breakfast for 2 but we wanted vegetarian option so we told the waiter to swap out the mean for something else or just more vegetables. Which is not hard to and don’t cost as much at the mean products. I would have given it 5 stars but being in flexible…I mean,can’t we be inclusive for dietary restrictions? Coffee was really good I must say.  Service:The waiter was really friendly and made sure everything was clean and tables were set.  Atmosphere:Spacious and aesthetically pleasing to the eyes."
Coffeeman coffee roasters,"Decent food though not sure if I would come back for it, pretty standard cafe tasting food. Came for dinner so may be more suitable for breakfast/lunch. I found the flatbread to be a bit oily and messy to eat. The vibe is chill and it’s a nice place to chat. Servers were helpful and also gave wine recommendations. Overall would say it’s an okay place to come if you’re in the area."
Coffeeman coffee roasters,"food was really delicious!! we ordered a full breakfast (contains meat) and veggie wonderland (vegetarian). we could choose between sourdough and whole meal for the toast, and the ways we wanted the eggs to be done. the portion is huge for 3 people to share. i especially enjoyed the veggie wonderland; each item on the plate was well-seasoned and complemented one another. the staff were cheerful and friendly too. music can be a tad loud, here but some people may enjoy it for the atmosphere!"
Coffeeman coffee roasters,"We came here for coffee and dessert. Service was generally good, though the initial seating experience could have been a little better and more welcoming. The coffee was nice and the desserts were tasty. What gives me pause is that the overall value proposition was poor. Two standard coffees, a small slice of cake, and some tiny churros cost as much as our lunch."
Coffeeman coffee roasters,"The ambience here is great! The cafe bar concept worked really well with the Spanish/Mexican and industrial design. Keeping it vibrant yet minimalistic. The drinks were alright, nothing wow-ed me but hopefully I would get to visit again and try the hot food."
Coffeeman coffee roasters,"Ambience: This place has a very relaxed, friendly and cool vibe which is perfect for a day with friends or family. Might be a bit too loud for a first date though.  Food: We loved the food and coffee. Although I might add that the pumpkin hummus needs a bit more flavour. Besides that both dishes that my friend and I ordered were delicious and filling made with good quality ingredients  Service: very professional, friendly and efficient. We were promptly greeted at the bottom of the stairs by a staff member who then got her colleague to help us. We were seated immediately and attended to without much wait time.  All in all, it’s a tried and tested place to which I have returned time and again."
Coffeeman coffee roasters,"This restaurant is definitely one of the top three brunch places that I have eaten at in Singapore this year! I was really hungry at the time, so I ordered a dish that looked like it had a large portion, and it turned out that the portion was really big. I even took the leftovers home and they still tasted great after reheating. If I have the chance, I will definitely go there again. The only downside is that the restaurant is a bit hard to find. After getting off the car or subway, you have to walk a little bit, and if you're not careful, you might miss it.  You can choose whether the eggs are scrambled, sunny side up, or over easy. The roasted mushrooms are very fragrant, and the texture is just right - you can see your own bite marks. The rectangular shape is crispy and fragrant mashed potatoes, with a crispy skin and a soft and warm interior. My friends and I both thought this was the best thing on the dish. The bacon was a bit salty, but it tasted good when paired with the other foods. After writing this review, I already miss this restaurant and can't wait to go there again!"
Coffeeman coffee roasters,"Awesome food, I wish they had Singaporean breakfast menu, but everything was absolutely delicious. Pretty filling so make sure to make your way here hungry!  Coffee, interior design, greens in the area was also very good!  Highly recommendable for family, pet owners and tourists of all kinds!"
Coffeeman coffee roasters,"Service here is good but food is expensive. Pancakes at $24++ !!! Looking at the portion & ingredients, totally not worth the price. Croissant :croissant: with ham & cheese plus rocket leaves, $18++, it cannot get anymore expensive than this. Seating is quite cramp too where tables are very close to each other. Not conducive for private conversations. Furthermore we didn’t like the sour taste of the coffee. Despite all the negatives, this place is still crowded. Probably cos it’s located in high end residential area.  *Edit: See the owner’s reply. I think they don’t understand my comment cos I never said I enjoyed the food. They must be delusional. Hope they give better quality & bigger portion for the high price they are charging."
Coffeeman coffee roasters,"I recently visited this cafe and overall, I would give it a 4/5 rating. The food was definitely shocking because of its flavour - didn't expect much and I was pleasantly surprised! My Organic Eggs Benedict and my friend's Cubanos Sandwich both were really tasty. However, I did find the prices to be a bit on the pricey side, which might make it hard to justify regular visits if you're on a tight budget.  The real star of the show, though, was the coffee. It was absolutely delicious, and definitely one of the best cups of coffee I've had in a while. It's clear that this cafe takes their coffee seriously, and it definitely shows in the quality of the drinks they serve.  One downside to the cafe is that it can get very crowded, especially during peak hours. This meant that it took us a while to get seats, but once we were settled in, the service staff was very helpful and attentive. They really went out of their way to make sure we had a good experience, despite the crowds.  Overall, I would definitely recommend this place if you're looking for great coffee and delicious food, but it might not be the best choice if you're on a tight budget and looking for a regular weekly spot. Despite the prices, though, I think it's worth a visit if you're a coffee lover and want to treat yourself to a special brunch or lunch."
Coffeeman coffee roasters,"One of the best breakfast I’ve ever had! The umami avocado toast was so full of flavour and so tasty.  Really nice looking cafe, with prompt and professional service. We were seated at the bar and had our water topped up fast.  However, the food is quite pricey, especially the coffee is very expensive, we ordered the white coffee- it was okay but not the best Coffee I’ve had."
Coffeeman coffee roasters,What a great coffee place in the CBD. This place has transformed itself since when I was working in this area. I had a filtered slow brew beans from Ecuador. Love the textile and the mild and smooth finishing. Food was also lovely. The Turkish common breakfast was excellent. It’s a vegan selection yet is was so delicious. The peta bread certainly goes well the this hummus.
Coffeeman coffee roasters,"From the commonman coffee family so it's all good. Great place for small casual business meetings or if you're looking for a place in the CBD to chill and kill time.  They have more seating deeper inside the shop than you can see while standing at the door. Unfortunately, if you're alone you'll probably get the bar seats or something outside. Either way, nice place with nice coffee."
Coffeeman coffee roasters,Great brunch place with decent options. Slightly pricey but expected for its location.  Coffee was great. We had umami mushroom toast and croque monsieur and they were also great.  Small comment: the staff are not proactive to deter people smoking outside near their guests.
Coffeeman coffee roasters,We enjoyed every dish especially the chicken. So crispy and well-spiced. Their flat bread was also very fluffy. Staffs were attentive and friendly. Nice atmosphere!
Coffeeman coffee roasters,"My 3rd visit here and finally i got a seat. (1st 2 visit, i left cos it was full) Very small shop with probably 3-4 tables. I'm very (very) impressed by the Service + Toast set i have. Keep it up guys. The nicely charred Toasts with the thick butter really rocks. i must say i really loved how generous u r with the butter (unlike others :) ) , becos thats why it tastes even nicer. Presentation of just this Toast Set is very good as well. My Iced Kopi is done nicely and not to mild also. Thick and nicely balanced. Another point to mentioned is as i sat there observing u guys while waiting for my set - service was extremely personalized and cheerful. The lady was full of smiles and sincere each time a number is called. I'm sure many other customers will agree on this. Look forward to your expansion and when more seats are offered. As a regular coffee guy who relaxes at other places weekly for my chill session - Tbox, Ykun etc, i really think yours rocks.  Updated - came again but sadly no toast today as they had a huge order. Ordered the Beef Cheeks Sandwich and boy was this good. Superb. A little on the higher $ at $10.80 but it was nice."
Coffeeman coffee roasters,"Super generous amount of chicken in the chicken salad sandwich! On first look it looked like there’s much sauce, but it tasted just nice. Love the touch of onions in there.  What really impressed me was the coffee. I got a kopi siew dai and it was brewed using an espresso machine. The coffee and milk really blended well and it was so smooth! It feels like nanyang coffee at an elevated level. :thumbs_up_medium-light_skin_tone:"
Coffeeman coffee roasters,Nice coffee from this shop at TPY central.  Friendly owners and can see they prepare every cup diligently.  Maybe still newly launched and wants to make sure every cup is good.  Only feedback is to change the lid of the takeaway cup as it does not sealed properly. Will be back to try their toast and other drinks.  22/5.  2nd visit. Tried the ying yang kopi and peanut butter toast.  Both are good. Especially the peanut butter toast is so savoury and not too sweet.  I think peanut butter is slightly salted and goes so well with the bread and the coffee. Eat on the spot is recommended.  12/7  Today tried the masala tea and kaya butter toast.  Very nice masala tea.  Butter serve on toast also higher grade than normal kopitiam.  They also upgraded the lip of the cup so no spilling like before. Plus the usual welcoming and smiling owners brighten your day.  Upgrade to 5 stars.
Coffeeman coffee roasters,"Wholesome breakfast experience here. Half boiled eggs were perfectly done, as good as Yakun. Limited seats outside for those who prefer to dine in."
Coffeeman coffee roasters,"This shop is very conviniently located just right next to Courts and opposite Secret Recipe.  They offer banh mi, hainanese breakfast set and a variety of coffee and tea selections (with masala and frosties I find quite unique).  Ordered the Kaya Butter Toast Set with Teh. Toast is standard with coconut kaya. Eggs are well cooked with no translucent egg whites (I get upset stomach otherwise). The teh is rich in texture.  Woman at the counter was very kind.  I find that this fills the void of good breakfast spot quite nicely in Central, especially if you're working in the area.  Update 13/07: They have seats now! :raising_hands_light_skin_tone:"
Coffeeman coffee roasters,Really amazing food and the coffee taste even better! I've been looking for a place to get my daily coffee fix and this has to be it! Can't wait to go back for more! Will definitely recommend!:)
Coffeeman coffee roasters,"Happy for a new and cheaper option for coffees at Icon.  Tried a kopi off peak, was good kopi. Self order kiosk is easy. Love the cool disposable cup too.  There’s a queue pre-office hours and at lunch."
Coffeeman coffee roasters,"#1st review# I tried the iced teh-o and half-boiled egg. The quality of the tea is commendable. However, as someone with a sweet tooth, I might consider requesting additional sugar next time to suit my personal taste preferences.  As for the egg, it was perfectly cooked and of excellent quality, leaving a satisfying impression.  I had the opportunity to try their kopi, and I must say, the quality and depth of flavor were truly impressive. The balance of sweetness was just right, adding to the overall enjoyment of the coffee.  Note: payment mode only accepts nets and nets paynow at the moment.  #2nd review (two weeks later)# I ordered a large hot teh-o and a half-boiled egg today. I was surprised by the size of the large drink, it was quite gigantic. The sweetness of the teh-o was just as I remembered from my first time trying it. The half-boiled egg was still delicious.  Suggestion: staff to clean the table when they are not serving any drinks."
Coffeeman coffee roasters,Really nice boss and staffs. Love their matcha latte (both iced and hot)
Coffeeman coffee roasters,"We were quite excited to try this new place but sadly left quite disappointed. Ordered Kaya set with tea:  - Toast not crisp - Drinks overly sugary - Far too much plastic packaging  Since its early days only, hope you can take the feedback and get this right :winking_face:"
Coffeeman coffee roasters,"Good ambient to meet up with friends from overseas but very disappointed at the food quality and service! Ordered the “Warm Ancient Grains Bowl” which the pumpkin seed went rancid (the smell and taste when nut is oxidized). Both waiter and chef checked and claimed that it is normal?! Just to clarify, my two friends and I all could taste the rancid taste. Can’t imagine how the chef couldn’t taste out or is it just to “protect” themselves? Was a loyal customer of common man and always buy coffee beans back home but from now on I need to rethink twice. Very disappointed on the overall experience and especially when I brought my foreign friends there. Hope the restaurant owners could take a look at this incident and provide better service training and quality control on the ingredients. After all you are running a restaurant!"
Coffeeman coffee roasters,"A lovely breakfast place in a beautiful setting. Great options on their menu, loved the juices and the coffee is great. Expect a busy crowd whether it’s weekdays or weekends, kinda popular for the residents and cyclists on the weekend, and not surprised. The staff is wonderful, and the restaurant itself is beautiful and tasty food. Had a great time at lunch as well here and their sandwiches are huge, and good for sharing. And it’s a pet-friendly place :)"
Coffeeman coffee roasters,"I absolutely love this cafe! It's hands down the best place in the neighborhood for coffee and breakfast. The coffee is rich, smooth, and always served just the way I like it. The breakfast menu is diverse, and everything I've tried so far has been delicious. The staff is friendly and welcoming, creating a warm atmosphere that keeps me coming back. If you're looking for a fantastic breakfast and a perfect cup of coffee, this cafe is a must-visit! Highly recommended! :hot_beverage::cooking:"
Coffeeman coffee roasters,"Delicious brunch at Common Man Coffee Roasters last weekend. And the location in Sentosa offers a relaxing and nice view of the marina. We had the Umami Mushroom Avocado Toast, the Common Man Veggie Wonderland and the Chili Chicken. All main dishes were very good and beautifully presented. For desert we had the Açai Bowl which was huge! And for a healthy balance I’m recommending the kale, cucumber, apple, mint and ginger juice."
Coffeeman coffee roasters,"One the best coffee cups I've had.  The Ethiopian Jabanto from Yirgacheffe is probably the best one for us.  They offer all-day dining, absolutely delicious baked items, a great breakfast, and a lunch menu. Try their avocado toast with various mushrooms and side of hash brown."
Coffeeman coffee roasters,We pick this cafe randomly as we were looking for a place for lunch.  The food was great.  Especially the French toast. However the sitting time of 45 mins was too short and we were being asked to leave even though we had not finish as there was another group which need our table despite that there are outdoor seats still available.  If you think you can finish within 45 mins.  This will be a nice choice in the area
Coffeeman coffee roasters,"Coffee is great!! Love the coffee beans and choice of oat milk, blends so well together :heart_hands::hot_beverage:. Loveee the smooth pour and latte art as well :smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes:.  There’s limited seats available, and seats are placed really close to one another, which is honestly not the most comfortable. :eyes: other than that, all is good!"
Coffeeman coffee roasters,Great flat white! Toasted sourdough with ham and cheese hit the right spot! Crunchy and flavorful. Nice vibes to chill with limited indoor seats but more outdoor seating. Order at counter and food was served to table. Friendly and attentive service!
Coffeeman coffee roasters,Good coffee. I ordered Espresso and Latte. Atmosphere was nice too. Simple design and it makes the place pretty interesting and relaxing. Carbonara is also very good.
Coffeeman coffee roasters,There are several coffee near this area. We choose this one because I want to try their backed eggs in a bowl and with the pita bread. Since I don’t like the meat so they replaced with mushrooms and I think it’s good but a little bit watery. I added 2 pieces of sourdough it’s tasted ok. My friend ordered the spicy :hot_pepper: mushroom aglio which I thought it taste good! Spicy and tasty. But a little bit oil when nearly finished. Recommend. The coffee i don’t like because too sour for me. Overall I think it’s good and can try if you pass by! Nice place.
Bakers Bench,"Heard of their amazing bakes and bought some bakes to go. These two bakes were perfect for someone who loves fruity refreshing flavors in their savory bites like me: :croissant: Twice-Baked Orange Almond, and :croissant: Bear Claw (hazelnut chocolate ganache and house jam). They are both 100% sourdough croissants. Steam toasting them before serving is necessary for crispy texture and warm softer fillings."
Bakers Bench,"Variety of choices~ Bread, coffee everything is quite nice. The best thing was not so crowded inside at 12pm :winking_face:"
Bakers Bench,"Tried a whole bunch of stuff here!  - Salmon Dill Croissant ($7): really yummy! we were expecting the traditional croissant but it came in a spiral with salmon bits haha but the croissant was really nice and flaky - BBB Club Focaccia Sandwich ($10): my friend and I didn't really like the tomato spread on the bread... maybe a pesto would be nicer? - Sticky bun ($6): pretty good! - Banoffee sourdough danish ($7): not sure where the toffee is..? There was just a lot of chocolate - Ricotta blue cheese flatbread ($8.50): I didn't like the texture of the cheese but this was my friend's favourite dish - Bacon and cheese croissant ($7): I thought this was really weird haha it wasn't cheesy? and there was some vegetable inside? like the kimbap radish LOL I dunno - Bear claw ($5.50) (not pictured): not too bad, but a bit overrated imo  Prices were pretty decent and service is quite good! We pre-ordered, and then ate some stuff there and dabaoed some stuff back, and the staff were very accommodating."
Bakers Bench,"abit expensive but their cottage pie ($8.50) was really good! it was crispy and great tasting :thumbs_up_light_skin_tone: the ambiance was great as well, lots of natural sunlight through the window if u sit at the side! would be a great place to study and chill in the future!"
Bakers Bench,"Interesting takes on pastry with a homely vibe. I like the presentation of the pastries on the counter. It gives the place quite a homely and unique vibe. (As opposed to the typical racks used in starbucks/other bakery franchises)  So far tried the 4 cheese galette and the salmon croissant. The salmon croissant was somewhat ordinary. I'd say the nearby Bread and Hearth bakery has better croissants in terms of fluffiness and the feeling of freshness. So it gets a 3 out of 5. (Noodles in photo were from a different restaurant)  The 4 cheese galette was really good. Will definitely be back to try the other pastries on offer, especially the cakes which look yummy.  It's a 4.5 out of 5 for me.  Also tried the chai latte for takeaway. Was kind of disappointed by the small volume compared to other coffee establishments in the area. Given that the price is 7$ I'd expect a larger volume. However taste-wise it was good. So this gets a 4/5 for me.  Took away both times as I live nearby. Might try dining in one of the days perhaps with a friend or two. But will definitely be back!  Nice and friendly staff as well. Place is not very big but seems like there're spare seats even on weekends/pub hols brunch timing."
Two Bakers,Staff not really friendly maybe because it's afternoon time. Or it's a long day but the attitude of staff very standoffish not a nice place if people are going to be like that towards their customers. Wearing masks too but can see from body language staff not happy to serve. Food just so so portion tiny prices very expensive. Designs looking nice but taste just normal.  France has :hundred_points: much better pastries than Singapore at a fraction of the cost.
Two Bakers,This place is dog friendly cafe. Had simple breakfast with our dog seated outdoor. They served nice coffee and they provide bowl filled with ice water for our dog. Thank you
Two Bakers,"Our afternoon tea experience was unfortunately a disappointment.  I have been here many years ago before they renovated their cafe. I remembered enjoying their deserts and hot drinks served.  Sadly, my return trip post-COVID turned to be a wasted trip.  Sora - crust of this cheesecake was not palatable. The cheese was overpowering and the citrus flavour was not evident.  My chai latte was too sweet for my liking.  We will not be returning anytime soon.  Hopefully, their refreshed menu will be a good change."
Two Bakers,It’s a lovely cute cafe for brunch!  Quality of the food is top-notch! We ordered pick your own so we can choose exactly what we wanted for our breakfast! Specially impressed with the croissant! Come try yourself!
Two Bakers,"In terms of taste and presentation, the food never disappoints. Everything tastes as good as it looks!  Service was prompt. I like that they served the pancakes in less than half the expected waiting time.  Staff is friendly and approachable. The place is bright and airy. Only downside is it can get pretty noisy when it is crowded. Can be challenging to have a conversation at the table."
Lola's Café,"Order the following: -Nacho Cheese Tater Tots. Crispy and nice twist with the cheese and paprika. (Rating: 4/5) -Crab Cake Benedict. Great amalgamation of ingredients. Found myself really satisfied after each bite. (Rating: 4/5) -Mushroom Grilled Cheese Sandwich. Great blend of the 3 different cheeses. Highly recommended. (Rating: 4/5) -Iced White. Decent and typical. Can’t go wrong. (Rating: 3/5) -Iced Passion Fruit Earl Grey. Nice and refreshing. Definitely a great order on a hot, scorching day. (Rating: 4/5)"
Lola's Café,"Got the crab cake benedict which was yummy, though the pulled pork benedict was average and the sourdough got soggy after awhile due to the heavy amount of sauces and guacamole. Coffee was good too! Service was attentive, and the food was served relatively fast considering it was a busy weekend.  Wouldn’t mind returning to try their other mains! Better to reserve a table to avoid the queue."
Lola's Café,"Great food quality.  Loved the strawberry pistachio tart. I think there was white chocolate inside. The pistachio taste is rich and strawberry slices are fresh and not sour :grinning_face:.  The crab pasta is so yummy and flavourful, highly recommended.  The pork collar risotto is amazing as well. The pork got a bit dry towards the end but the risotto is so delicious. Love the touch of fried kale but the dining experience would be elevated if there are more fried kale and if the pork is more moist and juicy / bursting with flavours.  I love the new renovated place- the interior design is beautiful with the new curves, lighting, and this new spacious space makes people feel so comfortable. Staff service is great as well even though everyone looked really busy."
Lola's Café,"- Food is honestly great, normal cafe price, around $30/pax.  - Crowded, come early, went for the brunch menu and comes with free water.  - Bought their $25 shirts, super high quality and really cute"
Lola's Café,"Finally got a chance to eat here as our past two attempts were met with long queues. The ambiance is quite cozy. Definitely a good place for friends gatherings. We had the Paprika Wings, which was very yummy; the Lola's breakfast; Pull Pork Benedict and Truffle fries. The staff were all very friendly and service was very prompt"
The Glasshouse,"Glasshouse at Chijmes is an absolute gem! The moment I stepped in, I was captivated by the stunning ambience and the abundance of natural light flooding through the glass walls. The interior design is both elegant and modern, creating a welcoming and pleasant atmosphere.  The food was exceptional, with a diverse menu that caters to various tastes and dietary preferences. The dishes were beautifully presented and tasted as good as they looked. The staff was attentive and friendly, making the dining experience even more enjoyable.  Whether you’re looking for a cozy spot to catch up with friends or a romantic setting for a special occasion, Glasshouse at Chijmes ticks all the boxes. I highly recommend it to anyone seeking a delightful dining experience in a remarkable setting. I’ll definitely be returning for more memorable moments. Five stars!"
The Glasshouse,I had a very nice avocado toast with fried egg. The orders goes via a QR code. Unfortunately there was no option to choose how you wish the eggs to be cooked. I had a runny egg which I can’t eat.  Coffee was good.
The Glasshouse,"really enjoyed my brunch here! chicken dish had very balanced flavours - great combo of the sweet potato, grilled chicken, grilled tomatoes and guacamole mash! highly recommend this dish; as well as the scrambled egg truffle toast! coffee was just alright, but impressed by the lunch items and great ambience"
The Glasshouse,"I had a chance to dine out for breakfast this morning. So we decided to head to Glasshouse after seaching on google. Very pleasant surprise. This little cafe is tucked away in a corner in chijmes. The decor with live plants all over the cafe makes it so relaxing and chill. The menu looked so good that we had a hard time deciding what to have. I had a made my own breakfast with bacon, creamy scramble eggs, sauteed mushrooms and sourdough slices. The bacon was nice and crispy and not too salty. Eggs was good, not too dry, creamy. Butter is charged at $1 a slice. Hmmmm. I thought it could be complimentary upon request. Coffee wasnt too bad but i had a triple shot black. We also had an order of tater tots to share. Crispy on the outside, soft on the inside. The mac and cheese is simple and not too overwhelming. The revuelto gramajo is something special. Argentinian scramble eggs, smoked ham, fried potato fries with house made tomato relish. Service is prompt and proper. Overall very good experience. Not a big crowd so we did enjoy the quiet moments."
The Glasshouse,Had the breakfast burger and cubanos. Cubanos came with a side of chips and it was filling and overall tasty. My friend thought the breakfast burger had an unappealing sauce to it. Nice vibes but service could definitely be improved.
The Glasshouse,"Food was average, though ambiance and service were good. I wouldn’t come back though; felt it was a tad over-priced and not value-for-money!  Pictured: - Revuelto Gramajo - Breakfast Bagel - Coffee (White)"
The Glasshouse,Nice ballroom with heigh ceiling and natural daylight. The food is also good and the staffs are really helpful and friendly. Highly recommend.
The Glasshouse,"Service was pretty chaotic. They served only half the table with food while the other half was missing for more than 25min. There didn't seem to be clear ownership of service staff catering to each table. Food was high quality, but it's really hard to have consistently good delivery on every plate. The beef was tender, fish is fresh but I would have liked more sear on beef and crispy skin on fish. Sauces were quite rich and felt heavy after a few dishes."
The Glasshouse,"Attended my cousin's wedding here. Food was average, service was slow. The only saving grace is the decor of the ballroom with high ceiling and tall glass windows, making the place appear grand and impressive."
The Glasshouse,Just attended a wedding dinner. One of the better Chinese wedding dinners I've had. Food was exceptional. Good food presentation
The Glasshouse,"Ordered the following: -Fried Chicken Burger. Chicken thigh is juicy and batter is flavourful. However, the thigh by itself tasted a little bland. Perhaps it could have been marinated a little longer? (Rating: 3.5/5) -Ham & Cheese croissant. Standard tasting and nothing out of the ordinary (Rating: 2.5/5) -Glasshouse Sourdough Waffles. Great and love the blend of the maple butter with the waffles (Rating: 3/5) -White iced. Standard tasting and honestly, tasted just like McDonald’s iced latte (Rating: 2.5/5) -Montblanc. I feel this was the star of the brunch. Felt like a dessert on its own and great choice for cooling off on a hot day. Highly recommended (Rating: 4/5)"
The Glasshouse,"loved the ambience of the place! everything was super aesthetic. staff was really friendly and constantly checking up on us if the food was alright. we ordered the tater tots, mushroom ragout pasta of the week, corn fritters, and hummus with toast. everything was a hit! the corn fritters is a must try, it paired perfectly with the sour cream. hummus with toast was great as well, but hummus was on the dryer side. though slightly expensive, everything here was worth the price given the ambience and customer service."
The Glasshouse,Nice ambience. But could be crowded during weekends. Servers were friendly and attentive. No frills. Try their Dorayaki. Jam in between was nice. Not too sweet. Home made in restaurant. A good break from the usual sweets.
The Glasshouse,"Very aesthetic cafe but it has more of a restaurant vibe as you are seated and order through a QR code, then your order is brought to you. Staff are nice and bathrooms are clean. Really cute concept of conversation starter cards on each table. Overall would recommend!"
The Glasshouse,"Good coffee good food good ambiance, can’t ask for more. It’s become my usual go to place for my brunch cravings!  Love the idea of build your own breakfast so you get only what you want on your plate! Portions for ‘build your own breakfast’ (a la carte) are slightly bigger than usual cafe size so it’s good for sharing if groups want to get variety!  SCRAMBLED EGGS, MUSHROOMS, CREAM & CHIVE SPREAD WITH BAGEL $20++ Love the buttery fragrance on the soft, half set, slightly gooey, creamy scrambled eggs! The cream cheese and chives spread is creamy yet light and gives that umami taste during and after the meal; a perfect match with the toasted (rather) soft bagels! Grilled-baked Mushrooms are not too oily too! Super yums!!  Just one thing that I still can’t wrap my head around: why are portions for bread spread bigger that the portion of the breads? It’ll sadly contribute to more food waste. Guess many would prefer to pay half for half the portion. And as a consumer, I wouldn’t really want to pay for butter in a cafe.  Overall, will definitely continue to be a regular though ;)"
French Fold,This is a really unique place for savoury and dessert crepes. Never had anything like it before. The crepes were great - we had two savoury crepes and they were both crispy skinned and had great flavour from the filling. The menu is exhaustive and has an abundance of both savoury and sweet crepes. It’s quite a solid place for brunch and lunch in general.  Place is slightly small for larger crowds but it has a very nice vibe. When we went there it was quite packed - and it was also quite loud but nothing unbearable. The waitstaff are very friendly and attentive and food came out very quickly too. Prices are reasonable but definitely on the pricier side since it’s quite a unique offering.  Into crepes? Pay a visit!
French Fold,"Cozy ambience and delicious galettes that were light and refreshing! Had their white chocolate, speculoos biscuit crepe No. 20 and a scoop of houjicha ice-cream, sublime! A friend didn’t find the macchiato to her taste and the operations manager was attentive and generous in switching it to a latte. 10/10 good food and service, will be back!"
French Fold,"My experience here was disappointing, considering how excited I was to make it here and give it a shot. Moment I entered, there’s no welcoming no smiles, just asked “with reservation”? I said no, and they found out I’m just one and made me choose. Then I basically had to figure my way around from scanning, to think they had a lot of staff and just gossiping there in the counter. When I was journaling and sitting comfortably, in half Indian sitting position, I was approached by the waitress to say to please remove my foot on the couch. Then a family of 4 came and surprise, the staff welcomed in full briefing, explaining menu, bestsellers and served water from arrival. I may be a solo traveler and fellow Asian but all of us deserve to be treated the same level. I am still a paying customer. I just really wanted to get out after. The crepe was dry, the sauce “homemade caramel” wasn’t enough to make it tasty or flavorful.  I wish I had a better experience. More so, I wish that they would not treat other solo travelers the same way as I was, ever again."
French Fold,The food and staff were both excellent. Had such a wonderful time. Would definitely be back. The crepes are delicious and really hits the spot when you’re craving a galette. Pretty decent happy hour that runs all the way till 9pm too.
French Fold,"Came in for desserts and drinks so only reviewing based on that. Ordered 2 crepes , a classic crepe with butter and another with white chocolate. Crepes itself was pretty good with a nice chewy texture. However they sprinkled a little too much sugar on top and not only did it make the crepes very sweet, it was sugar granules and not powdered sugar so it felt like i was eating something very sweet and unhealthy. Drinks were also served in a very small cup and filled to the brim with ice, not a lot of value.  Place is pleasant and conducive to chatting with friends but my meal wasnt the best experience for me personally."
French Fold,"Good ambience and service. Crepes could have been better if there were more layers of flavours. The dessert crepe was not my favourite, personally not a huge fan of hojicha icecream, and the buckwheat seeds were too crunchy."
French Fold,"French Fold serves delightful galettes that capture the essence of authentic French cuisine.  The galettes are deliciously thin, crispy, and packed with flavorful fillings.  The ambiance is cozy, and the service is impeccable."
French Fold,"I love this place. I’m not a cheese person but fell in love with the cheese here recommended by Maribeth and has been hooked on since. Their onion chutney is awesome, sadly not sold. Their cheese is incredible, can’t find it elsewhere. The service is great! Ambience is chill and relaxing! Definitely top choice for branch!"
French Fold,"Had a seat outside at the Al fresco patio. Group of 5 people.  Ordered the crepes and fries. All tasted pretty good. What surprised me was how filling these French folds were considering how flat it was. Enjoyed the carbonara like sauce fold and the tandoori chicken one as well. Dessert was great too while again, being really flat.  The thing about this is that I’m not used to having such food I suppose. It’s not….. satisfying because mentally and visually, I feel like I’ve not ate much but my stomach is completely filled.  Thank goodness for fries though.  Damage was $33 per pax for 5 folds, 1 fries and 2 desserts."
French Fold,Delicious French crepes and galettes! I’d recommend trying this place at least once. My go to is the No. 4 which provides the savory flavor with the creaminess of comte cheese and egg yolk.  Great ambience - breezy if you’re seated outdoors. Efficient service and friendly waiters. Did not feel uncomfortably full after which doesn’t always happen with French cuisine. Would return!  Pro tip: Tap water is foc. Ordering and payment through QR code app which makes it super easy to split the bill if you’re with friends.
Alchemist,"Beautiful space and decor. As soon as I stepped inside I knew I was going to to get some good coffee. I was over at the camera rental house nearby and this place was highly recommended. I could imagine myself hanging out here all day looking out the front windows, drinking coffee with a nice photo book on the side."
Alchemist,"Tried the pastries here quite a few times already. Above average. Today had the chance to buy all the pastries. Almond croissant and butter croissant were quite well received, my friend says that their chocolate tastes like Nutella. Good place to do work, their coffee is great too. Pricey. One pastry for ~$5. Good to try if you are around the area."
Alchemist,Ordered ice white and one drink was with oat. Coffee is not bad! I prefer oat milk as the regular white was too bitter for my liking. It is quite a nice place to come by and chill. Noticed they had some merchandise as well. Will recommend :thumbs_up_light_skin_tone:
Alchemist,"Very smooth, can really taste the distinct notes especially with the San Juan Colombian beans option. Brie + Mushroom danish is a good savoury option for those without a sweet tooth, complements the coffee well. Atmosphere is great too! Overall 5 stars no doubt."
Alchemist,"Alchemist is known for its high-quality coffee. The latte is a popular choice among customers and is often praised for its rich and velvety texture, smooth taste, and perfect balance of espresso and milk. The latte is priced at $5.50.  The ambience at Alchemist Coffee is modern with a minimalist decor. The cafe is spacious and well-lit, with plenty of comfortable seating options for customers to relax and enjoy their coffee.  Overall, Alchemist Coffee in Singapore is a great place to enjoy a delicious latte and relax. If you're a coffee lover looking for a high-quality cafe experience, this is definitely a place worth visiting."
Alchemist,"Had dark matter white. Coffee was good. Cafe ambience is minimalist zen and calming in the midst of the busy orchard road. Would actually love for them to serve with proper glasses/cups for even better experience instead of disposable paper wares, though I understand it will complicate operations.  Can get a bit warm on a hot sunny day as they only have fans in the open concept cafe. Service can be friendlier and more welcoming."
Alchemist,"This is a relatively new and trendy cafe in the Orchard shopping area of Singapore. If you want a table, you may need to wait in line. You can also bypass the line and order coffee to go inside the cafe. The coffee is decent, but very bitter (espresso and cappuccino). We can find much better coffee elsewhere in Singapore."
Alchemist,"Coffee is normal but croissant is good. If you looking for a place for a coffee break, this will be the right place. They sell filter coffee too and coffee bean. May go back and try the hand drip coffee"
Alchemist,"Tucked away in the middle of Orchard, this is a great place to have coffee and chill/read/do other things. The coffee is good, and they also sell pastries. It's spacious and has lots of seats. You can also stay at the stairs in case it's full inside. No seating limit here."
Alchemist,"Hard and not that crispy pastry that was impossible to cut with a plastic knife. Ngl, might as well don’t provide. Service was mixed; the boy tried his best to accommodate to us while the lady at the cashier was having an egotistic attitude. Overall, will come back again for the ambiance and coffee."
Alchemist,"Good coffee from this local roaster. Choice of blends or single origins for espresso-based drinks. Uses Meiji milk. Default for the 8 oz white is a single shot. This latest double 8 oz white (Ethiopia Harfusa) had floral, fruity, chocolate notes but the flavour was not so vibrant. From earlier visits: Ethiopia Harfusa - floral tea notes. Colombia Veracruz - fruity notes."
Alchemist,"Alchemist is one of the better coffee places around the area and although there are multiple outlets they are able to keep the quality fairly consistent, good on them. As usual there’s the choice of two coffee beans, my fav has always been dark matter. Would also recommend hot coffee over hot, from what i hear as well it’s the better choice… In terms of location it’s in the middle of Hong leong building on the ground floor so, not obvious when you’re on street but easy to find once you come indoors."
Alchemist,"Nice space in the industrial area, enjoy the coffee in a quiet space, and just getting in the zone. Coffee is great, just be expected to have danishes only or even it been sold out. Overall love it but I might only just visit this space on a weekday(less crowded)"
Alchemist,"By far the best coffee for me since I arrived Singapore.   Lumos blend (Ethiopian) was fantastic - hi acidity, fruity with lovely aroma. My preference is double shot flat white with 6 oz (classic ratio).  All credit to the barrista, he has quite a skill!  Smooth texture, right temperature. Well done."
Alchemist,"Had an iced americano (afura/ arufa) and it’s really good, super fruity and refreshing. Worth a visit."
Alchemist,"Didn’t know they have an outlet here, but was told by my friend to check it out. Not too easy to find if you are walking from MRT Coffee is great as usual and comparable to other alchemist outlets, it’s 5$ for the small white and 6$ for the 12oz bigger white. as usual you can choose between two beans, for me it’s always the dark matter all day."
Alchemist,Just went in to this cafe to get myself a cup of latte. You can choose the coffee beans and the barista would prepare the drink. There are no specific seats for this cafe as seats are shared by a number of eateries. Something like a hot-desk concept. The latte was nice and creamy.
Alchemist,Good flat white with oat milk.
Alchemist,"Good coffee from the newest outlet of this local roaster. There was only their Dark Matter blend (Brazil Rio Claro, Brazil Rio Brilhante) available when I was there. Uses Meiji milk. The double shot 8 oz white had a chocolaty, nutty flavour but the flavour was not so vibrant, and there was a burnt aftertaste."
Alchemist,Love to have this as my mid-day booster! Snap this photo because it’s such a pity that your coffee art isn’t able to be seen after being covered by the take out cup.
Alchemist,"My favorite coffee in town, the flat white with sugar is just sooo awesome, and the staffs there are friendly and nice. Will come back often :)"
Alchemist,"My first time trying the coffee at this branch. It differs from the others in that there are no seats, you just have your coffee to go. It was a busy weekday morning when I went, but the order was processed promptly. Got a hot white and black to go - I had the black, it was fragrant and strong. Perhaps a tiny bit too hot when first made, had to wait for a while for it to cool down before it could be drunk!"
Alchemist,"Excellent coffee. Choice of two of their blends or single origins. The default for the regular size white is a single shot, while the default for the large white is a double shot. They use Meiji milk. This latest regular double shot white (Colombia Cauca Finca Las Brisas) had floral, fruity, tea notes.  From earlier visits: Double shot 8 oz whites: Kenya Muranga Riakiberu AB - grape, tea notes. Brazil Rio Verde B70 Citric Black - green apple, nutty notes. Nicaragua Los Altiplanos - robust and had fruity, winey tea notes. Papua New Guinea Jiwaka Arufa - pineapple chocolate notes. Papua New Guinea Jiwaka Arufa - robust and had pineapple chocolate notes. Papua New Guinea Jiwaka Arufa - robust and had blueberry chocolate notes. Ethiopia Yirgacheffe Amederaro Konga - peach, earl grey tea notes. Rwanda Buf Ubumwe- tea, chocolate notes. Dark Matter blend - prune, chocolate notes. Ethiopia Haru Suke - robust and had blueberry earl grey tea notes. Peru Buenos Aires - robust and had chocolate, cane sugar notes. Rwanda Buf Ubumwe - plum, jasmine tea notes. Ethiopia Shakisso Tima - earl grey milk tea notes. Ethiopia Haru Suke - earl grey tea notes. Ethiopia Haru Suke - floral, tea notes. Ethiopia Harfusa - fruity, milk chocolate notes but could be more robust and clearer in flavour. Ethiopia Kochere - fruity, chocolate notes but flavour could be clearer and aftertaste could be better. Equilibrium blend - chocolaty but vague fruity notes. Double shot 12 oz whites: Colombia La Joyeria - almond, chocolate milk notes. Lumos blend - blueberry notes."
Alchemist,This is one of my regular barista coffee take away place. The coffee is amazing and the staff is always very attentive. It get really crowded during lunch hours so you might need to wait for your coffee!
Alchemist,"Hidden gem for great coffee in international plaza ground floor. This is one of the 2 best coffees I’ve had in the tanjong pagar area, the other being equate coffee. Here I had the latte and the dark matter bean. The other choice seem to be more fruity. I really enjoyed the dark matter latte, definitely recommended"
Alchemist,"Been here twice. Unexpected find in an industrial building.  Coffee is good! Not the acidic kind. The mocha seems stronger than the white coffee even though it's the same type of beans.  Very cool vibes and comfortable seating area available. Conducive place for working! They don't play loud music either.  Will try their pastries next time!  Parking is within the building, though the lots are strangely laid out."
Alchemist,"Coffee - 3 stars, ambience and aircond 5 stars. Lovely cosy cafe at an industrial place. A little disappointing as coffee was quite milky. The iced one seems strong than the hot one. Maybe I will stick to iced next time but since the environment is quite comfortable, I will probably be back whenever I’m in that area."
Alchemist,"If you're into coffee and chill vibes, this place should among the top cafes on your list.  We had two white coffees - 1 with the Dark Matter blend and 1 with the San Juan Colombia single origin. Both were exceptional. The Dark Matter was the perfect ""comfort coffee"" - dark and nutty with the lingering taste of molasses that makes for a very drinkable everyday coffee. But the San Juan was something else - bright and refreshing with a hint of berries. I thoroughly enjoyed my San Juan, but both cups were very well made and easy to recommend.  We were a little self-conscious about coming with a toddler who might ruin the vibes, but the staff were very friendly and welcoming. Not all fancy coffee places are this accommodating to parents with young children, so we were very appreciative. We'll definitely be back!"
Alchemist,It's a hidden gem that ticks all the right vibes of good coffee. Great atmosphere and music that will ease ur day when you are there. Coffee is great and very well thought out.
Alchemist,Superb service and they take their coffee seriously. I had to wait for seats to open but They informed me right away one the table is ready. The place is very nicely designed in a unique building with parking. I enjoyed the coffee and the exhibition next door in the same building.
Alchemist,The location of this bistro was so key while staying at the Holiday Inn Clark Quay. It’s approximately 80m away and if you time it right you can stop in on the way out and stop in on the way back. The owner is knowledgeable and very helpful. I did not have a chance to try the food regretfully. But the beers are cold and they serve half pints (which are my favorite. It’s never too much and hardly ever too little). The purple velvet couches are a nice touch to the pub esthetic.
Alchemist,"Fantastic and unique outdoors open mic venue. Seriously, you gotta come on down and hang before it closes in March '23. The staff are insanely friendly, the beer is usually cold, the music is a blast and the audience is super into all of it."
Alchemist,"Great little bar with extensive craft beer menu, both local and imported. Their food menu is no joke either with their Alchemy's Chef's special wings making you come back for more. Alfie and Isaiah are definitely amongst the best owner/barkeepers we have ever met! Now that live music is allowed in Singapore again, you might find yourself at an open mic night when you next drop by!"
Alchemist,Friendly people and service! Nice ambience and great selection of wines.
Alchemist,"A nice little corner chill place, friendly bar staffs, and a range of funny bites I didn't get to try. Great ambience for a quiet drink. $14 for a pint of Asahi draft"
Alchemist,Beautiful space and it was opened on labour day. Coffee also tasted great. There’s also a water dispenser at the side. Only issue is I don’t know why don’t they use proper coffee cups instead of takeaway paper cups.
Alchemist,Pro :Must have white with dark matter bean. Nice pastry too! Very cozy environment and I like how the baristas is wearing collar shirt :thumbs_up_medium-light_skin_tone:  Con: seats are not good. Low table killing my neck . Probably made or this way so customers won’t seat for hours
Alchemist,"One of the best coffee places in Singapore. There was a choice of 3 blends or single origins for espresso-based drinks. They roast their own beans and use Meiji milk. This latest regular double shot white (Colombia Valle del Cauca Potosi Tres Dragones) was robust and had pineapple, cherry notes.  From earlier visits: Regular double shot whites: Colombia Antioquia Los Tres Mosqueteros - whiskey, milk tea notes. Colombia Valle del Cauca Tres Dragones - robust, creamy and had pineapple, cherry notes. Excellent. Ethiopia Yirgacheffe Koke Shalaye BE - sweet aroma, was robust, and had cherry, guava, floral, tea, chocolate notes. Colombia Antioquia Los Tres Mosqueteros - robust and had green grapes, orange, chocolate notes. Ethiopia Yirgacheffe Koke Shalaye - robust and had blueberry, earl grey tea notes. Outstanding clarity and strength of flavours."
Alchemist,Ambience - 5 stars Coffee - 1 star Service - 1 star  Coffee has a strong acidic aftertaste. Only one option for tea (the cascara tea is a mix of sour plum & dates) : really awful and regretted my choice :thumbs_down_light_skin_tone:  Will have been better if they indicated the taste notes of the tea on their menu.
Alchemist,"Bought a cuppa on their first day of opening! Really really good and stoked to have them in the building where I work. The pastries also looked fantastic, even though I didn’t have a chance to taste them. The next time around!"
Alchemist,"I used to think I had a pretty good handle of what SEO was about. That was until I met Joseph who really 'schooled' me on the nuances. He took time to provide deep insights into how we could improve our search presence and boost qualified traffic.  If you're looking to get started on the right foot with your SEO, I encourage you to reach out to Joseph. He's an honest, competent and very accommodating provider."

I highly recommend their service to any business looking for an increase in traffic and a steady stream of qualified leads that are ready to do business."
Alchemist,"It has been a pleasure working with Joseph Ho and his Alchemists team over the years. Their professionalism and expertise in web site development and SEO optimization has had a direct effect on our bottom line. We are greatly appreciative for the quick response to our questions and concerns, and for the timely completion of projects."
Alchemist,"Joseph was kind, friendly, and most importantly knowledgeable about the issue at hand (SEO). He recorded a screencast in which he explained to me the problems in depth, and even took the time out to research the issue out of goodwill. Highly recommended!"
Alchemist,We are very pleased with Joseph Ho from E-Alchemists for ranking up our website to the top of Google! E-Alchemists really did a great job with the search engine optimization!
Alchemist,Friendly and addictive fragrances that had me smelling my friend constantly! Had a great time and the staff were so accommodating to our taste and recommended superb scents… will be back for more for a bigger bottle! I’m so happy to smell great. Have you ever had a perfume that tickles the right part of the brain?
Alchemist,"The female sales person there when we went was so friendly and accommodating, allowing us to smell the many oil scents available ranging from floral to herbs and of course explaining each scent that we were curious about. A purchase comes with a cute pouch to put your perfume in. My sister and I bought 2 30ml bottles with our chosen scents for $65 each. Mine is  silk musk with french vanilla. Mummy!  I hope to come again soon!"

Alchemist,I chanced upon this fragrance shop (and also referred by a batik shop within the same building) so I dropped by since I’ve been curious about fragrance oil. Aidan was warm & welcoming and quickly introduced me to the various scents available and asked about my preferences. He then recommended and tested the various notes on my skin and we compounded a bespoke version to my liking.  I ended up filling a few rollerball bottles and a spray bottle of different scents/volumes with him and I’m loving the concoctions unique to my character/moods! I recommend  this for anyone who loves fragrances or looking for bespoke gifts!
Alchemist,Service is great! Elouise is really helpful and engaging in helping us identify the most suitable scent. Walked away with a nice customised scent! The wife is happy too!  Love the engraving work by Adny!  Thanks Elouise & Adny! Will come by again for the next scent!
Alchemist,"Thank you to The Alchemists Design & Gabby for a pleasant experience in our first renovation journey.  We had Gabby as our ID and from the start, she was patient, accommodating & professional in responding to our queries & requests.  Problems were also communicated & rectified promptly, giving us a peace of mind throughout the renovation process.  Overall, it was a pleasant renovation experience & we would highly and gladly recommend The Alchemists Design to home owners who are looking to renovate their place!"
Alchemist,"Definitely recommend The Alchemists! They are also the one recommended by my friend. We got Jasmine as our ID! I am very impressed with her experience, professionalism and how responsive she is. Whichever I requested to her always on point! :thumbs_up_light_skin_tone: She always thinks of what is the best way to do things that I didn’t even think of. She plans everything in advance without needing ask her. Just completed the renovation and the costs is still within my initial budget which is best thing. Many of my friends having nightmares with other companies IDs. I’m really glad we had Alchemists and Jasmine to build our home :red_heart: Thank you Jasmine for your outstanding work. I have no doubt that you will continue thrive and provide best service as you always do!"
Alchemist,"After reading multiple reviews for a number of IDs, we decided to engage The Alchemists Design. Didn't even bother to meet with others. What attracted us to them is their many reviews on honesty, no over-promising, not pushy. They listen to your ideas while giving suggestions and alternatives where needed.  True enough that was exactly our experience with ID Haryati. The quotation was very transparent, every detail was included, no hidden costs. Haryati gave us honest opinions on material selection, space planning, tile designs etc. Any hiccups were dealt with promptly. Minimal stress on our side as she is such a professional.  Overall, we are extremely satisfied with our reno journey and how things turned out. The experience, the workmanship, the friendship forged along the way. No regrets. Thank you Haryati and The Alchemists Design!"
Alchemist,"We were really careful with our 2nd home’s renovations as we intended it to be a long-term home with our needs and preferences covered. Met about 7 IDs and had a good gut feel with Jasmine at The Alchemists Design right from the start. I had specifically asked for her after reading through the reviews and saw photos of  her works on The Alchemists Design Facebook page. No regrets as the renovation journey is generally smooth and on schedule. Jasmine’s aesthetic sense is balanced with practicality, and with the budget in mind. She’ll also share her thoughts on what work or what may not work, and I like it this way so that we make considered decisions. We wanted a darker warm contemporary theme with lots of storage space without feeling overly imposing and she hit the bull’s eye with her tasteful proposal. She also included elements of fun in our children’s rooms as well. Bonus is she’s a really pleasant lady to communicate with. Workmanship of the contractors are generally good overall as well, with compliments from visitors or even furniture delivery guys!  Definitely recommended! Thank you Jasmine and Team with The Alchemists Design for working with us to create our cozy home! :two_hearts:"
Alchemist,"We recently had the great pleasure of working with Kai. From our very first meeting, it was clear that Kai possessed a deep understanding of our personal style and preferences. She took the time to listen attentively, asking thoughtful questions to truly grasp the vision we had in mind. Throughout the entire process, Kai demonstrated an impressive level of professionalism and integrity. She effectively communicated her concepts, offering valuable insights and recommendations while respecting our input and budgetary constraints. Furthermore, the project was completed within the agreed timeline. Thanks Kai, for the pleasant journey of creating our dream home."
Alchemist,Good
Seng Coffee Bar,Back here and I’m glad that the food doesn’t disappoint! Creamy crab tomyam is definitely my new favourite! Should check out their latest promo - beer buffet Had a great night drinking with friends
Seng Coffee Bar,"We think the best dish has to be the rosti, the crispy kale was delectable and everything else was done nicely. The mentaiko max and cheese came a close second cause of its rich flavours and though it’s touted as a side, it’s good for mains for kids. The pork belly risotto tasted comforting, but would be good if it’s crackling pork belly instead. The seafood stew was the last cos we didn’t really agree with the soup."
Seng Coffee Bar,"Went before 11am so had the limited breakfast menu. Crab benedict is good for those who like the roe and they should state that it contains roe in the menu. The table next to us left half the plate unfinished. Me and my mum enjoyed it though. I wish there's something with the grilled cheese sandwich, like salad or roasted tomato dip but definitely appreciate that it's very affordable at $10. Ordered lava choc after 11 and it was very good. Definitely love that it's pup friendly!!"
Seng Coffee Bar,"I visited Seng Coffee Bar with my family for Sunday brunch and we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves here. As other reviews suggest, there's nothing to dislike about this cafe. The decor here is tastefully done, the staff are friendly and polite, coffee and food are great!  It's rather hard to find a cafe in Singapore who can nail all aspects and I must say I'm impressed.  We ordered a few dishes to share, and their tom yum pappardelle was the favorite on our table. The pasta is cooked to perfection and the sauce clings onto the pasta. I love that the tom yum is not too overpowering, and complements the al dente pasta really nicely. We will be back for this.  Their truffle fries are great as well, not overwhelmingly greasy and seasoned well. Most of the other dishes served were decent, but I'd have appreciated more seasoning on the other dishes as they were rather flat and bland; namely the bulgogi pork quesadilla, fried Nan Lu chicken and seafood stew. Extremely good ideas, just needs a little more seasoning.  I've had their iced lattes a few times and their coffee is amazing.  Overall a very nice place to chill and hang out with your family and friends. We'll be back again!"
Seng Coffee Bar,"Food and coffee were pretty good at this cafe. I think the grilled cheese needs something sour or acidic to cut through the richness -- maybe a pickle or a side of tomato soup, but the sandwich itself was deliciously gooey. The additional sides they offer are really affordable too. We also got the rosti, the beef cubes, and two drinks. All in all, would recommend this as a good place to hang out with friends."
Hvala,"Tried the cakes and pastries. The items are rich in matcha flavour and the portions are decently sized. A little pricey but the ambience and taste makes up for it. The food ordering system is also efficient. Service staff are friendly too. Overall, it is enjoyable experience and it is a good place to catch up with friends."
Hvala,Lovely ambiance. Not a big fan of the sesame tart but drinks and the other cake was great. One star missing cos there's a time limit to each seating.
Hvala,"Visited on a weekday afternoon (about 4pm). Crowd was okay as there were still seats! There’s a 1-hour time limit when you dine-in, but customers are allowed to stay longer if there’s no queue.  We got the cheapest matcha drink & the waffles! It was sooooo good :drooling_face: Highly recommended to get the waffles even though it took some time to be prepared!  Staff were also very professional and welcoming! Thank you for your service :-)"
Hvala,This place is almost always packed. Love the decor and zen feel.  Had a matcha latte and a waffle with matcha gelato.  Both were great. The waffle is outstanding and highly recommended.  Damage was around $25-30 for just those orders.  It’s definitely in the pricey side but you pay for the chance to pretend to be zen in a troubled world. :face_with_tears_of_joy:
Hvala,"Great place to chill and hang out and speak to friends! We had yuzu cake, matcha hojicha latte and genmaicha latte.  The yuzu cake was not too sour (coming from a person who doesn’t like sour food)! And it was well balanced in the flavour. Both lattes were great, definitely a place to come if you have a liking for matcha :)  Ambience: 10/10 Service: 10/10"
Hvala,"The zen-like decorations were pleasing and provided a unique dining experience. However, the place was crowded which spoiled the overall ambience (avoid the peak periods!). The drinks were average."
Hvala,"A very popular spot for all things matcha. I think I must have tried most of what’s on their menu. I liked the Hojicha cold brew for something clean, their matcha cake for something rich, and the outstanding waffle with ice cream of choice for something to share. Crowds come and go and seats are a tad uncomfortable but there is a variety of seating you can choose from which makes it all quite fun."
Hvala,"5/5 for aesthetics and chill vibes :) Very brightly lit and spacious area with few different types of seating (seats are prearranged and can’t be chosen, unless you are willing to spend more time in the wait-line). Different seating areas would be normal benches which where I sat at during this visit, or on the tatami area where you would have to take your footwear off, as well as at the steps area.  For drinks, we had the Yuzu Ice Blend, which was very refreshing; the Hojicha Latte, an Iced Orchid’s breath (which name sounds fancy like you are in a flower field; but is otherwise slightly mediocre and overpriced for the volume), and a Hot Spring’s Field Tea, which came with a cute cup.  The best out of all the food items we tried this round has to be the caramelized sobacha, which is an oatmilk gelato churned with buts of caramelized sobacha, adding a fun chewiness to the mixture. We also had the Goma slice, which is great for black sesame lovers, as well as a Matcha Petit.  Overall a solid experience and nice place to have dessert after a filling meal if you are around the area!"
Hvala,"This visit reminded me why I love Hvala even if it's super pricey. The brioche bun with red bean and ice cream is simple, but came in a substantial portion. All elements were delish and the combination just works. Tried their hojicha latte this time, it's just as good as the matcha latte."
Hvala,"Love the ambience and always a good spot to catch up with friends! My go to order is hojicha latte. Only minus point is that I didn’t like the brownie, but ice cream was vegan (from what I rmb seeing in the menu) tho so I guess good for those folks with dietary requirements!"
Hvala,"Lovely atmosphere. Matcha themed desserts! I had the matcha & goma latte which was wonderful since I enjoy both flavours. Served in a big cup at $9. Workers were friendly. There are a variety of desserts & gelato but I was too full to try them (next time!). Very calm and chill environment, highly recommended!"
Hvala,"We came here after dinner to relax and have nice drinks. Despite being a weekday night, it was relatively crowded and there was a queue to get indoor seating. They had 2 tables outside if you don't mind sitting by the road and in the heat - silver lining is that they will let you in automatically if someone leaves from the indoor seating. Ordering is through the self-service kiosk at the entrance and the drinks come quite quickly - the staff will serve it to you at your tables.  We ordered the Hojicha Latte and a cup of Sobacha. The taste was so good! I'm not a big fan of drinks that have a very heavy taste, but these were so well-balanced and you just know it was brewed in the right proportions. Overall vibe was really nice and cosy with minimal noise inside the cafe."
Hvala,"Starting off as a kiosk in Somerset, 𝗛𝘃𝗮𝗹𝗮 𝗖𝗿𝗮𝗶𝗴 is one of the establishment's recent forays into dine-in Japanese-style cafes. Unlike the other existing branches, diners here can expect a fully vegan and dairy-free menu with exclusive items. Done in hopes to raise awareness of plant-based options and encourage conscious consumption, the 70 over menu offerings range from cakes to tarts, latte and gelato.  Simulating the interior of a traditional teahouse, the outlet is shaped like a long art gallery filled with art pieces, wooden furniture, and plants, complete with a sunroof to provide a zen and cosy atmosphere.  The gelato, which Hvala garnered popularity for, comes in 12 flavours, all vegan using soy milk instead of the usual fresh milk. The scoops can either be served in cups or handmade cones, which are crispy and vegan-friendly as well. Aside from three types of matcha varying based on intensity, the Goma possesses a rich black sesame taste with light roasted notes.  The 𝗪𝗮𝗿𝗮𝗯𝗶 𝗠𝗼𝗰𝗵𝗶 𝘄𝗶𝘁𝗵 𝗚𝗲𝗹𝗮𝘁𝗼 features melt-in-your-mouth homemade kinako warabi mochi served with a scoop of either oatmilk or matcha level 1 gelato. The mochi, made out of roasted soybean flour, complements the creamy, robust and umami matcha taste, culminating in an earthy and distinctive flavour.  Similarly, a scoop of matcha gelato can be paired with 𝗗𝗮𝗶𝗿𝘆-𝗳𝗿𝗲𝗲 𝗠𝗼𝗰𝗵𝗶 𝗪𝗮𝗳𝗳𝗹𝗲𝘀. The waffles come crispy with a soft and chewy mochi inner texture, drizzled with golden syrup and topped with a sprinkle of fragrant toasted rice. Unlike the typical waffles made with butter and fresh milk, the ones here  use cinnamon and oat milk, making the texture more airy and uniquely fragrant.  As for the beverages, the tea leaves are obtained from traditional tea wholesalers from Japan. Amongst the many teas, the 𝗬𝘂𝗸𝗶 𝗠𝗮𝘁𝗰𝗵𝗮 𝗟𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗲 is a thick glass of freshly-whisked matcha layered with soy milk. Though slightly sweet by default, matcha lovers can explore a non-sugar version upon request."
Hvala,"Placed order at the kiosks in front of the shop. The staff will assign seats accordingly. Ordered the matcha ice cream with the highest intensity, did not disappoint. Houjicha latte was good. Matcha latte was normal. Can choose soy milk or oat milk for the latte. Many desserts were vegan-friendly too. Besides matcha related stuff, they have other refreshing options like ispahan. Prices were on the high side. Ambience was nice. Good cafe to chill if not too crowded. Time restriction of one hour when they are busy. Don't think it's quite fair for the shop to add service charge to the bill."
Hvala,Came here after a fulfilling dinner.  So ordered drinks and one cake to share. Cake is ok. Tea is not bad too especially they dont use cow milk.
Hvala,"Their matcha is always the best. Hojicha is amazing too. Warabi is soft and chewy, the brown sugar sauce is good to go with. If can have more yellow bean powder, will be good. The fork can’t really take out the warabi though. But it’s perfectly fine."
Hvala,"Felt like I'm in Japan the moment I stepped in. Friendly staff, we had the Yuki matcha latte with Hokkaido milk ($8+).  Very nice matcha taste and even better with the milk"
Hvala,A smaller of the other cafes with mostly for takeout rather than sit in and drink concept. Came to get a set of matcha whisk with a friend as a gift. The vibes are nice with a minimalistic interior concept.
Hvala,unique setup. the drinks are refreshing
Hvala,Really cool spot for elevated tea and small desserts. They have great trinkets and bags and tins of tea for you to enjoy at home
Hvala,"One tea place stands out among the gazillions of coffee shops sprouting like there's no tomorrow. Eye pleasing zen interior design, perfect getaway spot from your hectic day. Beautiful teas and machas, the kind that you will not find anywhere else. A must try for you, tea drinkers. Didn't try the food. It will be on the next visit."
Hvala,"-Cozy Japanese modern cafe -Tried the genmaicha latte, it was crunchy and not that sweet -Max 1 hour seating -No queue when I went on a weekday around tea time -E menu available by scanning the QR code on the table -Easy to make order and payment at the screens in front of the counter -Need to key in your table number so that your order will be served to you"
Hvala,"Always the best Matcha in town. Tried the matcha with syrup this time, prefer the original taste still. Tried the frappe with milk, it’s good but the taste not so strong compare with the original style. No waiting in the afternoon, no chasing us out too."
Hvala,"Zen vibes with fast moving q for Sunday. Love the Yuri matcha , where you can select oat milk and less/no sugar options! Perfect place to rest the legs after shopping"
Hvala,"I like the gemaicha green tea. It’s very fragrant, and has a nice nutty Amora. Matcha goma latte is not bad too if you like sesame. Ambience is not bad, service slightly lacking. Do note there is a one hr dining in time limit."
Dough Coffee,"Absolutely :hundred_points: good food here. The tater tots was on the sweet side which i prefer savory. The fried chicken batter was well done, so imagine, crispy on the outside and soft inside. The squid ink pasta fair poorly against the chilli prawn pasta. The platter was good, didn’t like the ham though, too thick. Young vibes here, service crew is good :thumbs_up_light_skin_tone::grinning_face_with_big_eyes:"
Dough Coffee,"I would give 5 stars for the presentation of the food but taste wise so so. Scramble egg not cook nicely. Food taste has no X factor.  Nice ambience and relaxing place but due to the high crowd flow, it’s kind of rush to be limited to 1 hr meal time.  Will come back again if crowd isn’t that much. Not worth to queue. Quantity 8/10 Taste 6.5/10 Presentation 10/10 Price 6/10"
Dough Coffee,"Gets crowded at lunchtime (no reservations so be prepared to wait). Very polite and friendly staff. Rosti is good, the sides that come with platter or rosti are more unique than typical brunch platter spreads. Latte was slightly better than typical cafes"
Dough Coffee,"Food quality is exceptionally :thumbs_up:good. June's monthly special gratin is superb. Fish is fresh too, portion a little small for me, big eaters take note, haha... bread pudding us amazing. Everything served promptly. Will come back again."
Dough Coffee,"Lovely location amidst the CHIJMES cluster located at a cosy corner  with both outdoor and indoors seating ! We walked in for a late Sunday lunch and though it was crowded , were promptly ushered to a table by the cheerful staff. The pull to the place was mainly this being a dog friendly cafe , but we didn’t have luck with any doggos today as they appeared to have gone elsewhere due to overcrowding by the hoomans ! Service is excellent here and all staff were cheerful and friendly! Food is average and not really value for money . The meat or fish dishes were not up to the mark ! Scrambled eggs are not good ! Rossetti was too oily , chicken was hard , Ribeye was so so . Bakes are good! Coffee in average . They have a bakery inside it appears . It’s also a concept and lifestyle store. The place however was full and appeared to be very popular with the youngsters mostly sitting with drinks and snacks ! Service 5* Ambiance 5* Food 3*"
Dough Coffee,"the bad: we noticed that their pepper bottle was dirty as the pepper grinds had clumped together on the inside of the bottle where (presumably) some liquid had gotten in. (see pic for reference)  we highlighted this to the staff and told them that they should wash this, but i noticed that they simply put the dirty pepper bottle back into the tray at the counter. not sure if they will wash it eventually but it was rather disgusting and unhygienic.  the good: we had brunch here- food and coffee were good. have tried their bakes before and liked those as well."
Dough Coffee,"Lack of good seat. Staff not so accommodating. I was alone, can’t even pass me the tray at the side. How do I chop place and watch my bags? Can’t even ask for a cup of water, they offer you to take from their tap :downcast_face_with_sweat:no filter water for customer, hot water pay $0.50. By the way the carrot cake don’t taste like carrot cake, more like cinnamon and walnut cake. My last spending in this place!"
Dough Coffee,"Their Baked Eggs with Grilled Vegetables & Toast was great. I really like their coffee. Overall, I would say the price is reasonable but not the best. It is pretty nice lunch and I would say a good place to eat at if you feel like getting something like shakshuka in bishan at a reasonable price."
Dough Coffee,"Was looking for a place to sit for a short while but was quickly kicked out for not placing an order, even though the outlet was completely empty, and way before closing time. Extremely rude and unaccommodating, considering they were not busy at all chatting away with one another, with leftover food and coffee littered on the tables."
Dough Coffee,"Good coffee, blueberry muffin and dark chocolate brownie were warmed before serving. Brownie was not too sweet, same with the muffin. Small space so seating is a bot tight. Note that there is a one hour limit when dining here so manage your expectations."
Dough Coffee,service was top notch.  we ordered salmon avocado sandwich. it was savoury and properly executed. the walnut muffin was moist and deliciously prepared.  Latte oatmilk needs a little bit more of Espresso.  Great experience. must try.
Dough Coffee,"Coffee is okay, not bad. Breakfast, the eggs were perfectly cooked to my liking, soft and still juicy. My husband had Breakfast Fried-up, the sausages (smoked chicken) was really good. I had scrambled bacon something :grinning_face_with_sweat:. The mushroom sauce on the egg was sooooo good. I really like it and the price is not bad at all."
Dough Coffee,"I like to take my break here whenever I can. The coffee is fragrant and nice. Price reasonable. Ambient is nice, cosy, comfortable for get together, meeting friends or even spent your own time there. The service is good, staff is kind, courteous, patient. Try it and experience yourself"
Dough Coffee,"Small cafe, located near the famous honey comb building. Nice service, the cheese case was delicious and so was the coconut latte. It was absolutely worth trying out this cafe. Peaceful indoor sitting area where you can sit and relax with your cup of coffee and a nice cake!!"
Dough Coffee,"Super poor service and bad attitude staff. Especially the barista in the photo. Please train your staff properly. If he doesn't like to work there, and keep showing attitude to the customers, feel free to let him go?"
Dough Coffee,Came here many times for their cappuccino/latte as the coffee here quite good compare the cafes around here. Like the quiet and peaceful ambience here too. First time try the all day breakfast and it's below average as the scrambled egg is cold and the toast is hard. Service staff was friendly and helpful. Will still like to come here just for coffee and cake whenever I am here.
Dough Coffee,"First time trying J&D. The breakfast sets we ordered were surprisingly good. I felt that the portion was reasonable. However, the serving time is slightly slower. But it was understandable because there was only two working staff.  Will go back for more in the future.  IG: Way.neologism"
Dough Coffee,"I fell in love with Gula Melaka cake at first bite:red_heart: Coffee is good, vibe in the place is very relaxing..will definitely go back to this branch!"
Dough Coffee,The flat white is eponymous - turned out to be flat. My wife ordered the chai latte and it turned out way better than was expected. The decor is hip and the service is good. I will return to try out the pastries next time and hopefully the next cup of coffee will be more appealing.
Dough Coffee,Having brunch 1st time at Joe & Dough. Total damage is $20 plus. Nice coffee
Dough Coffee,"I am thoroughly impressed with the nice environment and good customer service experience.  The atmosphere was cozy and inviting, with a rustic chic decor that added to the overall charm of the place. The service was excellent, with the staff being both friendly and efficient.  As for the coffee, it was simply divine. It is top-notch, with a rich, full-bodied flavor that left me wanting more.  Overall, I would highly recommend this cafe to anyone in search of a relaxing and enjoyable dining experience. Whether you're looking for a quick breakfast, a leisurely lunch, or a cozy spot to curl up with a book and a cup of coffee, this cafe has something for everyone. So, it is a perfect place to spend some quality time with your loved ones."
Dough Coffee,"Nice piccolo latte, ok gula melaka cake. Came with an hour before closing and oven was already closed so no warm cake. :thinking_face: The perfect pairing set was value for money. Seating was a bit close so we were a bit affected by noise next to us but I guess this is unavoidable in crowded malls."
Dough Coffee,"Haven’t been to J&D for years. Glad there is one at PLQ. Wanna try the hot cross bun - Promo price of $3 for the bun with any drinks ordered. Service is pretty good.  Need to come more often before I can reevaluate the number of stars. :face_holding_back_tears::face_holding_back_tears: As of now, I would give it a 4 :glowing_star:.  I really like the comfy sofa seats. The decaf lemon grass hot tea is nice, and the hot cross buns are tasty.  :cherry_blossom::cherry_blossom::cherry_blossom::cherry_blossom::cherry_blossom::cherry_blossom::cherry_blossom::cherry_blossom::cherry_blossom::cherry_blossom::cherry_blossom::cherry_blossom:  My gf & I visited on a Fri nite. We were lucky to get a sofa seat. My gf and I like the Key Lime Chia Seeds Tart. I like the Matcha Tart. I’m glad they are not too sweet.  However, I was a lil upset cos when I needed to get water, the young male staff flatly told me “NO” as they are closed. The water dispenser was just beside him. It’s a 1-min thing.  Unfortunately, he’s too rigid. So, I’ll still stick with 4 stars."
Dough Coffee,Love coming here for their Chicken sausage shakshuka! their drinks are also good - i love their matcha chocolate.  always coming here when i’m craving bfast food.
Dough Coffee,"Tried to ask for a full sized cup of ice after i ordered a coffee because i wanted to drink iced water, and i got a really small cup. When i asked if i could get a larger cup with ice i was told by a female staff that there were no more cups with the  cups displayed right in front of me. I found that rude but i asked another staff if i could buy ice and the cup they were giving me ice in was so small and they were charging me a dollar for it… is it that hard to make adjustments for your customers? bad service and attitude from staff, would not come back again"
Bees Knees Scenic Café,"The eggs bene were quite bland. Didn’t really think it’s nice. The smoked duck spicy fries was slightly better but had this weird spice that I didn’t like. I think it’s a tad spicy for me honestly and because it’s flooded in gravy, I felt it was a little too heavy.  The service was good. Although we were made to go outside and order when technically, the cashier is indoor and accessible from inside the restaurant.  The inside air con is not strong. So feels a little stuffy. Could be better."
Bees Knees Scenic Café,"Nice restaurant with alfresco seating at Botanical Gardens.  Initially greeted by a young male staff and got a bit confused by his attitude as it gave a bad first impression.  However, later we were served by a very friendly female staff and she made the dinner experience a lot more enjoyable.  She brought a dog bowl for my dog without us requesting as well.  The food was pretty good and enjoyable! There was a live band as well which kept the place lively."
Bees Knees Scenic Café,Dropped by for a quick breakfast before we started to explore the garden. Food and service was ok. Price slightly expensive. Almost full house on Sunday noon. Order and pay at the cashier. Very hot in outdoor area and prefer indoor. Pets friendly as well if you would like to bring your fur kids over.
Bees Knees Scenic Café,"Overall a decent experience, but the portion of prawn pasta was a bit small though.. they have indoor and outdoor seating.. went for the indoor one to escape the heat.. Service was good and good was not bad.."
Bees Knees Scenic Café,"I liked everything about this place until the food came.  - eggs Benedict wasn’t runny, was over cooked - fries were charred and just wasn’t pleasant overall  Would be back if they worked on improving food standards. For what we’re paying I do expect more than this"
Bees Knees Scenic Café,"I had a wonderful dining experience at a Bee's Knees Petite. The cozy ambiance and warm hospitality made me feel welcome from the moment I arrived. The menu offered a variety of delicious dishes to cater to different tastes. Their signature dish was a true delight, with impressive presentation and well-balanced flavors. The service was attentive and the staff showed a genuine passion for their food. I appreciated their commitment to sourcing local ingredients and promoting sustainability. The dessert selection was a perfect ending to a satisfying meal. Overall, I highly recommend this restaurant for a memorable dining experience."
Bees Knees Scenic Café,"Nice rest stop but a little overpriced. Had two coffees, a ham & cheese and a croissant for ~SGD40. The ham & cheese sandwich was alright but a little bland. Could've used a slightly tastier ham or added a sauce.  Croissant was surprisingly good for a spot that doesn't look like it bakes its own croissants though.  Coffee was decent. Worth a visit if you're looking for a rest stop while strolling through the park."
Bees Knees Scenic Café,This place has good coffee. And also here is shelter for traveler from heavy rain
Bees Knees Scenic Café,"Food is fine, served with disposables of quality for the purpose of sustainability within a cozy surrounding. 1 star is shaved off for its cleanliness - dirts left on chairs and table not cleaned, overflowed trash etc, on one fine Monday afternoon."
Bees Knees Scenic Café,Lovely place for lunch on a weekday. Just be aware that the chef might not be around on the weekdays
Botany Café,"The restaurant's name, ""Botany,"" reflected its emphasis on nature and botanical elements, both in its design and its culinary offerings. The interior was designed with a modern and nature-inspired theme, featuring plants, greenery, and a relaxed ambiance.  Key features of Botany included:  Farm-to-Table Concept: Botany had its own urban farm on-site, where they grew some of their herbs and vegetables. This ""farm-to-table"" approach aimed to provide diners with fresh and locally sourced produce.  All-Day Dining: The restaurant offered all-day dining options, serving breakfast, lunch, dinner, and everything in between. Their menu typically featured a mix of contemporary dishes with a focus on fresh and seasonal ingredients.  Retail Space: In addition to the dining area, Botany had a retail space where visitors could purchase various botanical-related products, such as plants, gardening accessories, and other nature-inspired items."
Botany Café,"Mediocre brunch fare more expensive than others. (I'm neither a horse nor a rabbit but the side salad tasted like grass) Flat white is flat. On the other hand, the croissant is impressive -- buttery, flaky, and crisp. At Botany, be prepared to spend to eat at a prime location overlooking the Singapore River."
Botany Café,"$150 deposit for table reservation/booking was too demanding. the deposit was deducted from credit card the moment reservation was made online. I called the restaurant to verify and was shocked when the restaurant said the deposit cannot be refunded even if we want to cancel our booking in advance.  At the restaurant, we were told that we can bring a cake, cut it but not allowed to consume in the restaurant. This definitely turn customer away.  1 male service staff seems to be underpaid cos he is rude and not friendly. he was not helpful when we tried to make order. i do not feel one-of-a-kind experience in a friendly ambience. Lousy experience.  the food was good though. I suggest maybe the restaurant should provide a training to the service staffs and improve the service skills."
Botany Café,"weekend brunch with a reservation. were informed that we only had 2hrs of dining time but they’d let us stay beyond that which was really nice of them.  personally think that the food was pretty average for the price we paid, but what we really enjoyed was the quietness of the neighborhood and the entire ambience - felt like we were in a different country without actually having to leave home.  would probably go back for their coffee and truffle fries, but maybe not for a full meal."
Botany Café,"BOTANY in Robertson Quay was our designated meeting place for a brunch rendezvous with an old friend and her toddler. Nestled between other eateries, and right on the riverfront, the ambience was green and welcoming on a hot and humid day. We opted to sit indoors where it was cooler. We ordered the Avocado on Sourdough Toast and the Steak and Eggs. Both were delicious. The Steak and Eggs need special mention. It was medium to well-done just the way I like it and the eggs were perfect. The Boss Baby did justice to his Brownies and Icecream with Orange Juice and demolished his way through the food, like a true boss! All in all a great meal!"
Kreams,Loved the artfully decorated cafe of a big tree spread with autumn leaves all over the cafe. The food was also delicious We ordered the hot plate rice cake and pizza. And for dessert we had the white choco cheese cake. Service was attentive. Really love this place.
Kreams,Attentive and proactive service staff.  Nice atmosphere.  Food: Almost all the food we order are super nice. Except the chicken in the Trio plate too hard. Tiramisu cake taste bitter.
Kreams,"Really cool cafe in CBD. The whipped cream was the best ever…I don’t even like whipped cream. Really cool inside decorations, coffee was nice and cheesecake was good too. It can get busy but seems like tables turn around quite quickly. They close in between lunch & dinner so be mindful of the time you go."
Kreams,"Best service ever! We went during weekend lunch hour and there were plenty seats available. As there were less diners that day, my friend and I had plenty of time to enjoy the pizza and dessert at the cafe. Free flow of water is also available and was re-filled whenever we need it. I’ll definitely visit again!"
Kreams,"Long queue outside during weekend. Drinks are little too sweet, recommended to request for less sweet on the coffees and drinks. Dessert is nice too but still a little too sweet. Environment is really nice."
Kreams,It's so delicious that I feel like eating it everyday..  Owner & staff are nice people!  Pricing wise 
Kreams,tiny cockroach in the flowers
Kreams,"Delicious comfort korean food lunch buffet at Kreams Lounge at URA centre. Thanks to my friend who discovered this lovely new Korean restaurant and bought me there. I was hesitated to have buffet for lunch at first, however the food were simply delicious with a wide selection of greens & salads. No, we didn’t over eat but we had a relax satisfying lunch at affordable price. Importantly the staffs were friendly and welcoming with our queries. Thank you for your friendly service."
Kreams,"had the $13/pax buffet lunch as part of the opening promo! selection was varied and food was decent, definitely worth the price. sadly the soft serve machine had issues )):  i really liked the cafe portion, although only drinks were available now. am looking forward to some bites/desserts in future!  the ambience and decor are 10/10. we managed to catch a glimpse of the team assembling a small tree - kudos to them for their hard work!!"
Kreams,"The salad and soft-serve ice cream were nice. I cannot comment on the meat dishes though, as it ran out! Shocking! I think the management didn't expect food to be snapped up so fast! 45 minutes and an emergency meeting later (between management and staff), there seemed to be new dishes served. I didn't get to try as I was already on my way out. :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing:"
Kreams,"(This review is for their soft opening time.)  The first time I ate a buffet, I felt that there was nothing to eat.  We sat in the restaurant at 11:30am (by the way, you need to pay the money first before you can enter), and then we can start to eat at 12:00pm.  When it was 12 o'clock, everyone queued up to get food, but the food portion was too small. When it was my turn, the meat dishes had already been taken by the people in front, leaving only a pile of bread, rice, carrot, and sweet potato.  So I can just go to salad bar and get some salad.  They also didn't add food during this time, you can see empty containers.  After about 40 minutes, some meat dishes just came out . The environment is quite beautiful, but the place is small, and there are not many types of food. And the plate we got (you only can get one plate to use) was also a bit dirty, you can see the oil stains on the plate, and you need to wipe it yourself.  Hope this can be improved in the future."
Kreams,"Had the buffet lunch for $13/pax (incl. tax). Food was decent, acceptable selection for cold and hot foods. The cafe next door only served drinks but no desserts. Perhaps the place is still new and still working out their operations. Looking forward to see what else they serve in future.  Atmosphere was nice and place was well decorated."
Kreams,"lovely ambience, service was very warm and attentive, free flow fruits and chips, fruit beer was great. not noisy, good for talking. food menu is very limited. couldn’t consume our birthday cake here though"
Kreams,"impeccable vibes, nice service and super nice ambience. chill music, good coffee, free snacks, amazing interior design. price not expensive also. talked to the staff for a while as it was empty, they were very kind and attentive and even asked if i wanted more snacks"
Kreams,"Great place for fruit beers! Lots of different flavors. Tried their white grape, peach, lychee and queen honey beer! All so yummy! There is even a little bit of ice slushy on the top to give it a better texture, something you don't get at other places. Not much food selection, there is only like 4 food selection. But it is more of a drinking place than a eating place. Food was ok! Servers are polite and generous with their chips serving. They also give you a complimentary plate of fruits once you are seated. We were there at 5pm sharp on a Saturday, no need to queue but there were people waiting for seats at around 6.30pm. Suggest that you reach early if you don't want to queue."
Kreams,"Nice food, cake and beers. Good place to hangout and gathering with friends. Service is good and ambience is nice and cozy. They give you complimentary snacks as well."
Kreams,"Gathering with my family n friend.  Nice cakes n drinks. Manager n waitress are friendly n attentive. Design is sweet. Toilet v clean. Price for food n drink is $$$. Overall, we enjoy very much."
Onalu Bagel,"This is a great little spot to grab a bagel sandwich and a coffee. Service is decent and the prices are reasonable for what you get. The bagels are somewhat limited in variety but they’re tasty. The ones we had were rather chewy, like a bagel should be. I wouldn’t say the texture was exactly like a NY bagel, but it was closer than most of what I’ve had in Singapore. There is also quite a lot of seating inside and out, so even if they’re busy, it’s not really a problem. Will definitely come back."
Onalu Bagel,"The bagel was really delicious; we ordered the bacon, egg & cheese one, and we would totally order this again next time. Deducting one star from the review because the coffee was too acidic.  Otherwise, this is a really good place to hang or to get some work done. :victory_hand_light_skin_tone:"
Onalu Bagel,"Had the portebello mushroom with charcoal everything bagel. The bagel is slightly chewy and not too tough, while the sesame seeds add a nice texture. The mushroom is juicy with spicy notes from the black pepper, and goes very well with the sunny side up egg and the veggies. The caramelized onions nicely ties everything together. Overall a nice construction and very appetizing :thumbs_up:"
Onalu Bagel,"Came at 12.30pm on a Saturday, cafe was crowded. Managed to get a seat indoors. Ordered the big breakfast with charcoal bagel and something fishy with sesame bagel.  The big breakfast (8/10) - this was such a good bagelwich. It’s practically comfort breakfast food all in one. I’ve had better bagel buns but in terms of ingredients, this complemented each other well. The secret sauce was similar to maple, along with thick cut of bacon and honey baked ham, Hashbrown and cheese; it was a very filling bagelwich (I was full after half of it). The secret sauce brought out the umaminess of the whole bagelwich and it somehow reminded me a little of McDonalds’s McGriddles but with generous amount of ingredients.  Something Fishy (7.5/10) - I usually prefer savoury food but this was a little overwhelming. To be fair, the amount of smoked salmon was incredibly generous and they have scallion cream cheese, red onions and tomatoes to cut the saltiness of the smoked salmon. Definitely value for money, but might be good to share this.  Ice white - smooth, but a little on the acidic side.  The bagels were almost sold out by the time I left the cafe which was around 2pm. In terms of value for money, this place is good and worth it."
Onalu Bagel,"reasonably priced, delicious and huge bagel! tried Somethin' Fishy with original bagel ($12) and was pleasantly surprised with the food quality and generous servings of smoked salmon. the scallion cream cheese and other toppings added a refreshing touch to the combi.  longer queue and wait time are expected during school semester. lots of outdoor seating available as well."
Old Hen Kitchen,"Old Hen Kitchen: Cafe features an Open-kitchen concept of which guests can observe the preparation of the dishes - Visibly Slow. Was informed 25 mins after the first order was placed that it would take another 20 mins to prepare due to lack of pasta. This could have been informed to us right from the start when ordering.  Taste-wise: Fish and chips were seasoned well, and there's no complaints for the fries either.  45-mins pesto pasta was okie. 4 stars :)  Reco: If you are in the area and okie to wait, the food is :OK_hand:; whilst service is definitely lacking and can be improved.  Cheers~"
Old Hen Kitchen,"A new brunch favorite in Singapore. Not lots of unique places here … a lot of same same, but not Old Hen. Great coffee and awesome food, I loved my rosti, and my friend loved his avo toast. Great service and nice vibe too! Highly recommend!"
Old Hen Kitchen,Went in for lunch on a Sunday. Have been here earlier for coffee and they do have some decent options there.  For lunch I ordered a spaghetti and my friend ordered a Roesti from a special menu. The spaghetti was tasty but not filling enough.  The huge mountain of greens on top does little to complement the main dish in anyway.  The roesti was good but my friend found the coffee very bitter .  Doubt id go here for food again as prices arnt offering much value either.
Old Hen Kitchen,"The coffee here is SO GOOD. I’m not even much of a coffee drinker but I crave their coffee. It’s very smooth and not bitter, complex flavors, deep and rich notes. The food here is also excellent. The restaurant also has an awesome vibe, the decor and ambience feels like a mix of a hip Tokyo coffee shop meets NYC neighborhood eatery. Really chill and quaint yet modern"
Old Hen Kitchen,"Dropped by for an iced white coffee! Loved the atmosphere with high ceilings, and open spaces.  Iced white (4/5) Our coffee was very balanced, mildly acidic and very smooth. There is really something about the milk that's amazing.  Matcha cold brew (5/5) Their signature matcha milk is amazing! Complex flavour profile that's refreshing, bright, slightly vegetal with sweet notes. They're definitely using high quality matcha! Plus points for being well blended with no powdery bits."
The Assembly Ground,"Food was just average for the price paid! (I feel like it wasn’t worth $23 for a plate of random breakfast food). Luckily I went with friends who used the burpple discount. I had their brunch so maybe they are better with their other mains?? I’m not sure either. But if you’re on a budget, i wouldn’t recommend this place. Other than that, place is pretty and service was okay!"
The Assembly Ground,"We had a family dinner there, waited 30min for a table of 7 bcos it was crowded Sat. The food was good, service could have been better, had to ask for more serviettes as it was not enough. They didn't provide a steak knife for a beef steak, had to ask for it. The cheese burger pizza was good, thin crust with good amount of beef n chrese. The assembly Burger with curly fries nice. The wagyu beef was good but the mashed potato could have come with more sauce."
The Assembly Ground,"Great food paired with great service to make a wonderful dining experience.  Food was served promptly and hot. Just take note if you’re planning to go during a peak period there might be limited seating spaces.  Another small point to take note is that they have a promotion where it’s just $3 to add a drink to any main, however this promotion is not available on public holidays which was the day that we visited."
The Assembly Ground,"Loved the pizza with mushroom and egg, it's really good. Have also ordered the chicken from the mains and the pork. Chicken was fantastic, the skin was grilled crispy, but the pork dish was a bit overwhelming for me due to the strong gamey flavour, which my friend joked about that the pork tasted too ""porky""."
The Assembly Ground,"Dropped by for dinner and was not disappointed! We ordered the B Supreme Burger ($25) and the Laksa Barramundi Pasta ($24). The pasta was nice but had lesser gravy than expected, though it was delicious all the same; the fish was well cooked- crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. The burger was really really good and a hard recommend for anyone deciding on what to eat. It came with a side of salad and curly fries that were so good!"
The Assembly Ground,"Nice atmosphere and comfortable vibes. Had the lunch set ($14.50) and it tasted pretty good. There was salad dressed in vinegar and olive oil, fresh mushroom soup and sliced baguette with a garlic spread. The truffle cream sauce and fish was pretty small and average at best. Not something i went ""WOW"" over but a pretty decent meal. Would definitely go back if the portion sizes were more generous."
The Assembly Ground,"So we had the duck pizza (22), miso pork(22), burger (22), chicken chop (17.5) and truffle fries (12.5) for dinner  The food here is actually pretty nice. Miso pork was the best honestly, but the serving is a little small however. The duck pizza was great except that the duck was literally 1 piece on each slice.  (We have a deal on the entertainer app, and basically got 1-1 main courses. Do check it out.)  Overall a decent experience. But returning here may be a little harsh on the wallet, so chance of returning is maybe around 25%."
The Assembly Ground,Excellent ButterMilk Chicken Burger! Nice n crispy without being too heavy and greasy like  typical chicken burgers you find everywhere.  Flat white was served perfectly without being too milky too.
The Assembly Ground,A very nice place. Looking forward to have its Assembly burger!
The Assembly Ground,I defo recommend this place for the pasta and pizzas!
The Assembly Ground,"Ordered the Assembly Brunch and Crab and Prawn cake Benedict. Portion size was fantastic, food was great and did not disappoint. The Assembly Brunch had a good variety, such as scrambled eggs, sausage, smoked salmon and bread while the Crab and Prawn Cake Benedict is really unique and filling. Would recommend anyone to come here for weekend brunch to try the dishes out."
The Assembly Ground,"Ordered the classic assembly bunch and the new spicy salmon pasta. Brunch platter was really yummy and the portions were huge. Spicy salmon was an interesting dish, will recommend to try! All in all a delightful Sunday brunch."
The Assembly Ground,We order this and its a very comfort food. Apple crumble is the best for me. Pizza is too big for me and my friend because its only the two of us. And staff was super friendly and kind. Love the vibe and ambience.
The Assembly Ground,We ordered the southern chicken and waffle and the crab and prawn Benedict. The poached egg was runny but the crab and prawn patty was ok only. The waffle and the chicken was really crispy and delicious. The staff were also really friendly and helpful.
The Assembly Ground,"Curly fries portion was huge!! Meat was juicy for the B Supreme Plus and Assembly burger. Free water. Used Burpple 1-for-1, ~$17 per pax. Good service"
Burnt Ends,"Food was good! Not mind-blowing as expectations were very high, but still very good. Smoked ice cream was incredible! Chef's counter seats are the best way to enjoy front row views of all the action in the kitchen."
Burnt Ends,Tried to book here for over a year and finally got a spot to celebrate my husband’s birthday. Tips for booking: sign up multiple waiting list and you might get one if someone cancels last minutes. It’s wonderful experience. Every dish is amazing. Got a chance to chat with the chef too (sitting at the bar table). One of the best bbq place we have ever been. Will definitely want to revisit.
Burnt Ends,"Great food service and ambience. You can taste the great quality n flavours presented in every bite.  Service is absolutely amazing. The team is great in recommending dishes too.  Its hard to get a reservation though, usually a month + in adavnce."
Burnt Ends,"Excellent food, beautiful ambiance, very good service. We were seated by the bar. I had the flat iron steak and we also had some appetizers. Had the apple tart dessert with ice cream as well. The steak was amazing. Everything was lovely. Worth the price."
Burnt Ends,Everything is as you’d expect at such a well known upclass restaurant. The food was fantastic and so was the atmosphere and service. We got the private room (can’t remember what it’s called) which was great to have our own private space and conversations. The food was truly well thought out and executed by the team and each course was well presented and explained. The ambiance was great and I appreciate the interior design and concept very much.
Fyr,"Had dinner with wife here. Great experience with very attentive staff and fantastic food served to our delight... ribeye and snapper!  Thank you Daniel, Shaf, Ibrahim!"
Fyr,"Great location with a quaint feel. Restaurant does not seem to be too crowded most of the time. Dishes are great for sharing among a small group of friends. Am a fan of the mussels, they are cooked extremely well with lemon garlic butter. Great to use the accompanying garlic bread to soak up the remnants of the sauce. Fish was also well fried - the skin is crisp and the accompanying pea puree a great pairing."
Fyr,It’s a decent alternative option for working day lunch if you want something a little fancier. The set course is priced well for what it offers. The taste is passable… the fish tastes like a lake fish which tastes decent only if you eat with the sauce. The brisket is very chewy. I guess it’s just too much hassle to sous vide the brisket till tender before grill.
Fyr,Delicious meal with good deals from the entertainer app. Loving the pork and sides / snacks here.
Fyr,"I came here for lunch today with a friend. They have a large a la carte menu, as well as three lunch sets. You have your choice of a starter and main, main and dessert, or all three. There are three choices for each item. Some items, like the ribeye, carry an additional charge. Service was prompt, attentive, and friendly. The food was also surprisingly good. It’s not cheap but it’s not crazy. I would come back to try other dishes."
The Feather Blade,"We had an awesome dining experience! Great food, great service and ambience. The steaks, the burgers, the gyudon...everything was just so  flavourful and juicy. Even the sides and truffle sauce tasted delightful. Would surely be back again!"
The Feather Blade,"Super crowded place that serves great steak. Sides was good too but the portions are smaller than expected. Love the steak. Reservations is a must. Oh, and try their Tiramisu, it’s fantastic."
The Feather Blade,Steak was done perfectly. Love the crab brioche. Staff were friendly and the whole place felt casual and cozy. They had a great song list too! Will definitely return!
The Feather Blade,Tried the steak here. It's pretty decent for the price and it tastes even better than some of the more expensive ones. The staff is very good. She knows the food they are selling and able to make good recommendations. Overall had a good experience:thumbs_up:
The Feather Blade,"Amazing night. We were sited at the bar when we arrived but when asked the staff moved to a normal table they arranged quickly for us. The food was really amazing, very worth the price. The music was at a good volume to create a nice mood but allowing us to hear each other speak. The 75min only dining time was a shame though as I would have like to take more time to appreciate the meal."
Saveur Bistro,"Nice French Resturant located at Purvis Street in Singapore. Had lunch with family and generally everyone was pleased with their order. Personally ordered the Set Lunch. Had French Onion Soup for starter, Grilled Seabass for mains and Creme Brulee for desert. Onion Soup and Seabass was great, the creme Brulee is alright, would try something else next time. Bread basket was great too, very fresh bread served. Overall the food was good and the service staff were pleasant."
Saveur Bistro,"A lively casual place for a birthday dinner, seating was a tad cramp & table was ‘just right size’ to hold our 4-diners plates, glasses & cutleries.  The set dinner had almost what we wanted to try - it did not disappoint.  We ordered an ala carte of escargots to share.  It was absolutely delicious.  The Bouillabaisse was generously portioned, but slightly salty.   The steak was cooked just right for us, but was a bit dry.  The dessert of brie & chocolate crumble was good.  Would try the lunch set next :smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes:"
Saveur Bistro,"The food here was very tasty, atmosphere - pleasant and service staff, friendly. The sauce for the steak au poivre is so delicious, I dipped bread in it just to savour it more, and the peppercorn crust is simply heavenly. Their peach sorbet also had a smooth and velvety texture that was divine. Highly recommend!  However, the tables are a little close together as it’s a small restaurant (understandably) but it may not be ideal for intimate conversations."
Saveur Bistro,Food were all good and mouth-watering! I personally love their Steak Au Poivre and the Angel-hair pasta(forgot the name). The desserts were so nice too. Perfect for a self-treat after a very stressful week! Thank you Cori and the team for your very warm and excellent service! Will surely go back!
Saveur Bistro,"Both main menus’ seasoning were too heavy and acidity for all menu was way too much. Only truffle pasta was good with dried shrimp. Service needs improve as there were only two serving staffs while the restaurant was full house, staff can’t have luxury to provide a good care; they served wrong menu and made to wait another 15min for the right menu, but no one asked excuse."
Bedrock bar & Grill,Spent a birthday celebration here with a family of 4 adults; pretty sure we over ordered (the side dishes were bigger portions than expected) but every dish was impeccable and fresh. Their wine list is also extensive but we had a bottle of red since we came for steak. Service staff Ruby and Gary took very good care of us throughout the dinner service. Happy to report we’ll definitely be back and recommending to family & friends!
Bedrock bar & Grill,"Very accessible location just adjacent to 313 Somerset below Pan Pacific suites. Has both outdoor and indoor seating Interiors appeared a bit crammed though. Food 5* Service 5* Ambiance 4* Price - Expensive Need to book , food is excellent! Staff are very courteous and helpful. The steaks are one of the best in Singapore. Barramundi fish was excellent. Brick pressed chicken also tasted good . Sides like Mac n Cheese , Baked Camembert are also worth trying and possible choice for vegetarians . Overall a epicurean experience."
Bedrock bar & Grill,"Lovely place with the most lovely service staff, Ruby. She recommended the steak to suit our tastebuds and didn’t let us over order. We recommend having the French onion soup, Mac and cheese and the steak! Came here for a birthday celebration, went home with a lovely Polaroid to remember the amazing experience. Cake not pictured but do come here for a celebration to try it! ;)  Will definitely be back!"
Bedrock bar & Grill,"Nice, spacious and dimly lit interior ideal for a date at an upscale steakhouse. Our host Ruby was very friendly and professional, and gave us great recommendations when asked. The signature pepper steak was excellent; so was the USDA ribeye. Highly recommended."
Bedrock bar & Grill,"Bedrock Bar and Grill seems to go above and beyond to make their guests feel welcome. Many customers have noted that the staff is attentive and helpful, going out of their way to ensure a pleasant dining experience.  So decided to try this restaurant and I have to say, I’m impressed. Service was great !! The food was delicuous. The cooking has really brought out all the many flavours.  Overall, it seems like Bedrock Bar and Grill is a great choice for anyone looking for a high-quality dining experience. With its delicious food, impeccable service, and stylish atmosphere, it's no wonder that so many people have raved about this establishment."
Armoury Craft Beer and Steak,"Ordered the PayNow $58 wagyu special and the five cheese pizza. We were pretty amazed by the quality of the steak, grilled to a perfect medium rare with a slight crust on the outside and pink in the middle. Their pizza didn't disappoint at all, rich and flavourful oozing cheese in every bite. The basil complimented the pizza perfectly. Definitely worth the visit."
Armoury Craft Beer and Steak,"Food portions are generous and value for money! Servers were attentive. We were seated outside and it got a little dark as the evening progressed. Servers offered us a seat inside once it opened up, but I think I would request for inside seating if possible in my reservation. $55 steak for 2 was really yummy! The XXL Vongole was great too."
Armoury Craft Beer and Steak,The highlight of this place is the onion rings. Hands down best onion rings ever. Onion is sweet and the batter is damn nice. The burger came with the hash brown and the portion is nice for one. It was really fried to perfection. Their pasta is great too! service is prompt and good. This place makes a great chillax place with friends!
Armoury Craft Beer and Steak,"Mac & Cheese pasta was decent 3/5 Wagyu Steak with bacon cheese was pretty good 5/5 Supreme Meat pizza was decent 3/5 Molten Lava Cake was not bad 4/5 Beer was decent 3/5 Overall was okay, price is slightly on the pricier point. Staff were friendly and helpful. 5/5 Has indoor & outdoor seating."
Armoury Craft Beer and Steak,"To start off, ambience was nice with good choice of songs, something I could vibe to! Generally the staff was very welcoming as well when we came! Best part was that it wasn’t too crowded, didn’t need to do much waiting!  Food wise, pretty good! We tried the buffet and it was scrumptious! We especially loved the chicken satay and the mantou! Ribeye was better than the Striploin and juicier! Overall pretty affordable for a buffet!"
Armoury Craft Beer and Steak,"Came for the new opening 1-for-1 mains deal. Restaurant wasn't so crowded but they are severely understaffed. Very difficult to get attention. Still, the staff were very polite and sincere, warning us well of the long kitchen serving times.  Had the steak and seafood pasta as part of the deal. The steak was pretty decent but I expected much more from it. I feel like the quality may have been compromised by the overwhelmed kitchen.  The wings, however, are something I wouldn't order again. The chicken meat was mushy and bland.  Still, it is a pretty decent place, with beer/shots o'clock deal. Nice hangout in a good location. Hopefully these issues will be sorted out, and this new outlet can get back on track to great standards."
Armoury Craft Beer and Steak,"My dining experience at this restaurant was nothing short of extraordinary!  The perfectly cooked steak with its delectable crust and flavorful meat. Pasta was well seasoned and very tasty. The sides, especially the baked potato and fries, were a delightful accompaniment. Mala popcorn chicken was excellent too. The mala seasoning was made by themselves and it struck the perfect balance between flavor and spice.  Beyond the exceptional food, the service was fast and the staff couldn't have been friendlier. The lively and vibrant ambiance added to the overall enjoyment of the evening.  I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a top-notch dining experience."
Armoury Craft Beer and Steak,"Saw the promo on FB & came here on a Sunday for late lunch. Reached just before 2:30pm, which was last order for the kitchen. Service staff checked with kitchen & gladly accepted our seating. Ordered 2 Ribeyes for the price of 1 at $28++ Not impress with the cut as there was so much fats & sinew which makes 40% of the beef chewy & inedible. Mac & cheese was surprisingly really good. One of the best we tried. Their beer promo is also very worth it. $3 per pint before 3pm, $4 at 4pm, $5 at 5pm, & so on. Will come back to try their Wagyu beef promo."
Armoury Craft Beer and Steak,"Armoury Steak is an extraordinary western restaurant that brings the spirit of the wild west to life in every aspect. Step into a rustic oasis where the enchanting scent of hickory-smoked meats mingles with the charm of western decor, transporting you to a bygone era of cowboys and pioneers.  The restaurant's exterior boasts a weathered wooden façade adorned with vintage signage, and a welcoming porch adorned with comfort chairs, inviting you to unwind before your dining adventure begins. Upon entering, you're embraced by the warm glow of Edison bulbs hanging from exposed modern beams, and the sound of classic country tunes.  Seating arrangements are diverse, offering cozy booths with rich leather upholstery, communal wooden tables, and a bar counter where guests can gather and share stories. The walls are plain and empty.  The menu at Armour Steak celebrates the flavors of the frontier. Signature dishes include tender, slow-cooked Texas-style smoked brisket, succulent baby back ribs glazed with tangy barbecue sauce, and perfectly seasoned bison steaks grilled over an open flame. Vegetarian options are available, such as hearty beef burgers.  The bar offers an impressive selection of aged whiskeys, tequilas, and locally crafted beers, along with classic cocktails.  Overall a pleasant experience and will definitely be back again for more."
Armoury Craft Beer and Steak,"A hidden gem at Orchard Central Level 11. Ambience was great, best part was that it wasn’t too crowded, a great chillax place with big group of friends!  The beef served with good saltiness, not overseasoned. Forgot to take pictures of the burgers though, the beef burger patties were juicy and well seasoned, the soft bun of the burger was nice. And the salmon carbonara pasta was one of my favourite dish too.  They are currently having an opening promo, $3 for a pint of beer was really worth it. Service was prompt, overall great dining experience. Would go back again!"
Waacow,"Must try the truffle fries! Very crispy. I find the pork softer than the wagyu beef, overall very nice food. Just a little noisy with many people drinking beers."
Waacow,"had spicy mentaiko chirashi ($20.9) + foie gras add on ($6.9). my foie gras looks like toasted garlic…. feels like it’s being pieced tgt from leftovers and overcooked which is a pity. chirashi taste wise is decent! wings are very good!  scallops are really good but i feel like one full scallop is being sliced into 3 pieces, and this entire plate only has 3 full scallops LOL portion was pretty sad"
Waacow,"Easily accessible, right outside Exit A of Raffles Place MRT. Food was nice. The torched wagyu was especially tasty! We weren’t going to order any dishes to share, but when we caught a whiff of the neighbouring table’s order of truffle fries, we had to order :face_with_hand_over_mouth: it tasted as nice as it smelled. Not cheap, but the portion was okay.  Only issue with the place was that the air con would go off at 8pm everyday (controlled by the building, not the restaurant) so we were really warm sitting indoors. But maybe just get a table outdoors if you’re going to be there beyond 8pm."
Waacow,"This hard-to-miss donburi spot is situated within a stone’s throw from Raffles Place MRT - the heart of the CBD.  As such, and in an establishment with closely-spaced tables, one will inevitably experience noise concerns. This is accompanied by upmarket menu prices, which only gets more eye-dropping when you are presented the bill (with taxes).  Nevertheless, an eye-watering tray of mentaiko chirashi donburi was promptly served, along with a set (+ $8.80, comprising a miso soup, 3pc salmon sashimi, goma tofu, and a drink of choice). I must concur that I arrived before the lunch crowd, so YMMV when it comes to being able to get your food quickly!  Food was tasty, but the modest portions left more to be desired. One is likely to leave hungry without ordering the set, but then one leaves with a pricier bill to pay. (the set is somewhat reasonably-priced, but paying upwards of $20 for the chirashi bowl is too dear).  If you wish to avoid the crowds and enjoy a better atmosphere, I would recommend dining at the Marina outlet instead.  3.9 / 5"
Waacow,The mentaiko salmon is perfect with big portion Wagyu beef is nice and tender with bbq smell but the beef portion is slightly little Waffle fries is soso with generous portion  Original wagyu beef $21.90 (add foie gras $6.90) Mentaiko salmon $20.90 Waffle fries $11.00 Asahi white $8.80 Excluded service charge and gst
Waacow,The ingredients like salmon and iberico pork were super tasty and fresh. I love the foiegras too. However the portion is slightly small and the price it’s on the high side.
Waacow,"Decent Japanese wagyu chain. They serve really declious wagyu beef. Try their truffle wagyu beef, must order item. Not being stingy with the truffle sauce, you can taste the strong truffle taste on every single bite. Foie gras immediately melted in the mouth. Price is slightly on the high side. But worth trying it!"
Waacow,
Waacow,"My 2nd time dining in, was happy and satisfied with their beef wagyu don. We have ordered 3 different don and some appetisers as well as sashimi platter. Food quality is superb. My personal suggestion is to have more sashimi options and sake."
Waacow,A little treasure hidden in marina One! Very delicious dons! Must try!  Serving is a little small for the price I feel but scrumptious nonetheless and savour each bite.  Service was great too! We came on a wed evening so the vibes was really nice and chill great for decompressing after hump day!  We ordered Mentai chirashi and beef bowl With 2 hot green teas! $46 total!
Waacow,"Amazingly delicious as always! My favourite beef bowl in Singapore, the best quality beef enhanced with truffles that tastes amazing! Ordered extra beef slices, truffle fries and mozzarella cheese sticks for sides. A little too much food for 2 but we couldn’t resist. Highly recommend the truffle wagyu beef bowl!"
Waacow,"Popular wagyu beef donburi restaurant. Reservation recommended, visited on PH eve and half of restaurants closed for private event. Onsen egg is delicious and definitely recommend to add. But the sashimi doesn't taste very fresh..rice is too dry towards the end. Service is friendly."
Waacow,"Nice beef bowls - had a hearty meal here. Truffle gyudon is one of my favourite. The portion is a little small though. Still recommend it! Try it if you're in the area, although on the weekends there's nothing else that's open around here since it's the office & business district."
Waacow,"Here 2 years ago but still remember the amazing taste.  The wagyu meat melts in your mouth and is so full of flavour, one of the best I've had in Singapore. Portion is very small and expensive for the size but it is really very good quality.  Worth a try if you have not tried it before."
Waacow,"Since it is not a busy time, I didn’t see any crowds. I bought it from the menu after scanning the QR code. Wagyu Don, Braised Meat Don and Chawanmushi are all delicious, but this is a good place to enjoy lunch"
Waacow,"Ordered the signature bowl, quite expensive for a student.  Beef is nice and tender. Best to mix with the onsen egg, rice and beef.  The portion is small however it is delicious."
Waacow,"Had the wagyu don, indicated medium but came out looking and tasting like very well done.. beef was rather dry, but still tasted good. Portion is okok, not big not small. Pricewise seems abit high especially in a university setting, although the food is good.  Window seats have a good view of utown green and utown plaza area."
Waacow,On the pricier side for what you get but overall a pretty decent bowl meal. Beef is tender and mixes well with the spicy mentaiko and onsen egg. Wish portion sizes were bigger.
Waacow,"Ordered two days in a row. Tried it for the first time as there was a 30% foodpanda promo. It was DELICIOUS!!! The beef slices are so tasty and the yuzu egg yolk is such a surprise! Do note that the portions aren’t big, it’ll likely leave you craving for more."
Waacow,"For a delivery meal, this is one of the more memorable and amazing meals that I had so far.  The portion is a little on the small side, so do add more rice and meats for the guys and bigger eaters. Perhaps will be nice to have a free extra rice portion like some of the Japanese shops.  Taste and quality wise, hands down. DAMN GOOD. Had the Wagyu beef bowl and ordered the chirashi for my younger brother and we both enjoyed the meal fully. 5/5"
Waacow,Mentaiko bowl and their regular wagyu bowl was excellent as always! Really glad they have a cloud kitchen in the East! Pricey but so worth it if you’re craving a solid quality beef bowl.
Waacow,"Have ordered from this stall multiple times. I finally ordered their Waygu bowl with Foie Gras to try.  Initially I was a little worried, not being able to choose the doneness of the waygu. I prefer my waygu to be rare. Their waygu was pretty much well-done but still retains the tenderness of it! Although I must admit their waygu doesn’t really taste like quality waygu,  however it is still very tasty and tender.  Their prices are definitely more expensive, $34 for a bowl of waygu beef bowl + foie gras + delivery charges. But the taste definitely made up for it. Good to have it occasionally.  Previously I have been ordering their Teriyaki Chicken Don and topped up with a piece of Foie Gras.  The delivery was very fast and it came neatly packed. I also asked for some chilli powder and they gave me a generous amount of it.  The food was great. Just the rice alone, mixed with the soft boiled egg and the teriyaki sauce from the chicken, is mouth watering enough.  The teriyaki chicken was very tender and flavourful as well.  The piece of Foie Gras is delicious too. I should have ordered 2 pieces instead.  Portion of the Teriyaki Chicken Don is slightly smaller as compared to other places.  Overall, I really enjoyed the food and will try their other dishes soon."
Waacow,"I ordered Original Wagyu beef salmon sashimi set (comes with a Wagyu beef bowl, 5 slices of salmon sashimi and a can of Coca Cola). To make my dinner treat complete, I also add-on a portion of foie gras. I placed my order on Thursday around 5 pm and Foodpanda app indicated the food will be ready in 10 minutes. The Waa Cow cloud kitchen is conveniently located at the exit of level 2 Tampines Mart multi storey carpark. Look out for directions.   Incidentally Foodpanda is currently offering 20% discount plus $4 voucher for self collection. I only pay $21.92 for this sumptuous meal. The Wagyu beef is “melt in your mouth” tender - every piece of meat is infused with a delicious smoky flavour. Every bite of the wagyu is pure delight to the taste buds. The well seasoned foie gras is heavenly.  The texture is like an exotic dance on the tastebuds. I can do with a bit more pearly grain of short grain rice to accompany the generous servings of ingredients. Definitely worth all the calories and super value for money."
Obba Jajang,Staff were all so welcoming and friendly! The songs played in the restaurant were so nice. I like jajjangmyeon the best. You also get to enjoy an ice cream after the meal.
Obba Jajang,"Great location, tasty food, excellent customer service, comfy ambience. Excellent place for family and friend gatherings. The queue can be long, which is not surprising given the reviews and the word-of-mouth marketing."
Obba Jajang,Loved the grilled meat! Really fresh and of upper grades~ wide variety of side dishes. Went twice and tried different dishes and they are all good~ Would loved to go back again!
Obba Jajang,":camera: Set A  :bacon: Now I understand why my friends used to suggest this location for food. Honestly is one of the best Jjajangmyeon you can find in Singapore. Huge portion as well, the set for 2 people can be shared amongst 4!  :ten_o’clock: Super long waiting time during dinner hours, I waited for slightly over 1h when I went at 6.30pm. Will recommend to go before 6pm if you want a shorter wait. Or you can go at unconventional dinner hours like 8.30pm or something.  :money-mouth_face: Relatively affordable if you are sharing amongst friends.  :fire: Definitely can't beat the ones in Korea in terms of price, taste, and portion. But suck thumb cause we are in Singapore. :)"
Obba Jajang,"First time trying, order their Jajangmyeon, seafood udon, kimbap and sweet sour pork. Everything is good that we order. Every dish is tasty and we finish it all though the portion slightly more. My wife tells me eat nice food must a handsome waiter. :face_with_tears_of_joy:"
Itaewon Jajang,"had such a huge spread here. we ordered all of this for 5 pax and bill came about $19 per person, which is pretty affordable. must order their jjajangmyeon, super flavourful and seafood was so fresh. very enjoyable meal. the sweet and sour pork was good too and pork remained crispy after being drenched with sauce. came around lunch and it wasn't very crowded."
Itaewon Jajang,Very authentic like korea food. Very nice food. And I would like special thanks to the shop worker to keep for me my wallet which I left in the toilet. Also would like to thanks the person who found my wallet and pass to the reception. His virtue and kindness will be rewarded many times to come.
Itaewon Jajang,"My friend and I were craving for some tangsuyuk and jjajangmyeon in a raining day so we went here. Tangsuyk: I think the sauce is lack of sour flavor, the pork is crispy and chewy. I'm team dip because I just don't want it becomes soggy after awhile. Jjajangmyeon: the sauce is thick and all ingredients mixed well together. Jjampong: finally we end up falling in love with the jjampong :face_with_tears_of_joy:. Some spice will kick your day so level 2 is perfect for us, and I love how the soup cooked with all the fresh seafood. The portion is HUGE so keep your stomach empty before coming or sharing between 3 small eaters."
Itaewon Jajang,Ordered ala carte for 3 pax and came up to a total of S$93.85.  The two pre-grouped sets come with only 1 jjajangmyeon but we were craving jjajangmyeon so we decided not to order the sets.  Portion is more than enough for 3 pax but we were craving kimchi pancake so we ordered at the very last minute.  Recommended: 1) Jjajangmyeon (Black Soybean Sauce Noodles) 2) KimChiJeon (Kimchi Pancake)  Could taste better: 1)  Tangsuyuk (Sweet & Sour Pork) - flour was a little too thick and the meat became a little chewy after the dish cooled down
Itaewon Jajang,"Wow I love this place, reminiscent of Oppa jjajang but I felt the flavours were better here. The jjamppong level 2 already had a spicy kick! Would come back for level 3 definitely and their spicy fried chicken that looks soooo good. Their Al Dente noodles are just so addictive."
Hanwoori Korean Restaurant,Nice respectable Korean restaurant in the Serangoon Gardens area. Comes with a variety of ban chan dishes - ten to be exact. I was personally expecting the meat to be grilled on the table but it was done in the kitchen instead. Pork collar was overcooked and tough to chew. The beef on the hand was done alright. The other main dishes that we ordered were slightly better than the BBQ option than we had.
Hanwoori Korean Restaurant,"Was here 8-10 years ago.  Haven't changed much.  If you're in the neighborhood area, definitely worth a try and give your own view.  Meat was well cooked and tender.  Love the little pot that serves the makkoli.   Reasonable priced I feel."
Hanwoori Korean Restaurant,"Food was really good. Between two of us we ordered a set for two, a seafood pancake, and a bottle of shoju. Cost about S$153. Lady boss was friendly and super efficient."
Hanwoori Korean Restaurant,Was served by the unfriendly lady boss until we do not dare to take extra utensils for scooping as we are sharing some food and total 9 of us . pancakes for seafood and kimchi were not crispy and were soft… service was poor thus you have to wait till they are free to top up your side dishes only one elderly staff n the lady boss serving for the entire restaurant.  No credit card accepted only paynow or cash.
Hanwoori Korean Restaurant,"Utterly disappointed. Seemed to have changed management? It was not this “lady boss” but a friendly older couple who served us (some time last year). 2 stars for Banchan cos they top up banchan instead of serving your order.  If waiting for average soggy pancake, watery soup stew is your thing then by all means. Otherwise don’t even bother. “Lady boss” just happily chatting away with her group of friends, leaving the 2 guys and (possibly 1) chef to handle the orders. Don’t expect your food to be served without waiting for at least 30mins on a weekday. Saw a table with 2 kids, still waiting for their food and eyeing the kitchen as we left. Avoid bringing kids unless they can wait… they deserve better quality food without the long wait. Terrible experience, Will not be going back."
Big Mama,"Food was enjoyable - though experience was a bit hectic as it was during dinner time on a Friday night. Food was also on the pricier side.  The staff were mainly Korean speaking and seemed quite irritated, especially when we ordered more food. But the food was great, really enjoyed the pancakes and pork dumplings! Side dishes and ginseng soup are refillable. Would come back to try the fried chicken as well."
Big Mama,"Had a really enjoyable meal here. Kids loved the shoyu meat and pancake. Bibimbap was excellent as were all the sides which were plentiful, distinct and authentic. Some of the best kimchi I’ve ever tasted."
Big Mama,"First time going to Big Mama for budae jjjgae and Big Mama did not disappoint! Probably one of the best budae jjigae I had in SG. Best of all is the free soup refills.  The kimchi, lotus root and anchovies side dishes were pretty awesome too.  The highlight of the meal was the yuja makgeolli (I kinda forgot the name) set that came with the pancake. The makgeolli was refreshing and very easy to drink. It came in a big pot too, definitely worth the price you pay as the set consisted of a makgeolli and a pancake."
Big Mama,"Banchan-side dishes: mayonaise-tossed boiled lotus roots and japchae are my favourite. All those offerred are really non-korean friendly.  Samgyetang-ginseng chicken soup: the broth is hearty yet not at all heavy, no season is added I guess, chicken is tender, falling of the bone but no taste to it I can feel.  Fried chicken: we chose 2 flavour, chili sweet and cheddar cheese. I have never thought the cheese one would be sweet. The chicken outer skin is cruchy and coated nicely with sauce/cheese powder, inside is juicy and bouncy. The price of the fried chicken 2 flavor mixed is $38, which is quite expensive.  Seafood pancake is my favorite, the batter being spreaded out thinly on the pan was just enough to incorporate the chives and veggie together so when the pan cake cooled down it didn't become so soggy, it even had a nice crust and not so oily.  The rice wine is a hit or miss, my friend liked it so much, but to me it tasted like soda.  Food served was quite fast, staff are attentive. We witnessed a real ajuma teaching her new waiter on his first day of work.  The ambience is ok, not crowded at all during Friday lunch."
Big Mama,Came to this acclaimed authentic Korean restaurant.. but the taste rather tuned to local flavour. A simple soya bean tofu soup supposedly a test for Korean restaurant authenticity .. however it was bland and lack of umami flavour that used to have in traditional Korean food. The signature Su Yuk : steamed belly pork was rather overly cooked .. so hard to chew and no lettuce to serve but instead of white radish ! The leek Korean pankage probably the best so far.. the Dakgalbi : spicy grilled chicken was average and added rice to fry later made special! The beef soup was disappointing .. too bland and not flavorful!
Big Mama,Price range is on a high side but the food especially topokki does not taste up to expectations as compared with other korean restaurants
Big Mama,"Had dakgalbi and seafood tofu soup , which was comforting in the rainy weather."
Big Mama,"Thank you for your services. I had no hope for my suede jacket, which returned as new. Great experience as well with a stained shirt collar and pillows/duvet. The website is convenient for scheduling pick-ups and deliveries."
Big Mama,"Curtain was torn after Big mama's cleaning process. Use their service at your own risk. After this occurrence,  I realised there were many bad reviews on their dry cleaning service.  Company claimed that the torn was part  ""wear and tear"" as the curtain was “aged” and ""prolonged exposure to sunlight"" and it is a ""common issue"". As a consumer, I am unable to assess if my landlord's curtain was “aged"" and definitely unaware that it will be prone to ""tear"" as a result of dry cleaning. If this is a ""common issue"", as a professional dry cleaning company, shouldn't you highlight to your customers such potential risk. Company said because the condition was not serious that was why not highlighted. That being the case, how can the company shirk responsibilities over the damage.  Very disappointed with the way the company chooses to handle the incident."
Big Mama,Do it at your own risks! Dry cleaning outcome isn’t guaranteed! The company will not take any responsibility and they blame it on your product quality. Curtains were damaged and shrank!
Big Mama,"Incredible service! I had my wedding dress picked up, dry cleaned perfectly and returned to me in a week and it was very affordable. A+ service."
Big Mama,"If there’s 0 star, that’s what I’ll rate. I sent 2 of my Loewe jackets with leather pockets for dry cleaning. The leather pockets originally are smooth and nice. But when delivered back to me, 1 of the jackets’ pocket is all creased up and embossed logo nearly diminished & flatten out. Yet another leather pocket is ok. Asked them for an explanation, end up as usual, they just shirk responsibility, afraid that they need to compensate. And they simply blame it as wear & tear, which is ridiculous cos it’s damaged by their dry cleaning.  This is such a bad experience with this laundry company. And I truly urge you guys not to send your dry cleaning to them if you don’t wish to damage your precious apparels."
Big Mama,"The best: auntie is really friendly and accommodating to my requests. Appreciate it!  The good: the service is really good. Dry cleaning and cleaning service done well on my clothes.  The bad: it's a bit pricey. The price is the same price as knock knock app, so it might be more convenient to have that."
Big Mama,"Came across Big Mama as i happen to be around the vicinity and had the chance the meet auntie Rosita!  Chatty, humble, professional and gets the job done despite my urgent timeline! Would definitely recommend anyone who is looking to get their suits drycleaned!  And yes, we even took a selfie :squinting_face_with_tongue:"
Big Mama,Laundry shop in West Coast Plaza. Came here to dry clean my 2 piece suit. One week to collect. 2 different staff members attended to me when I dropped off and collected my suit. Both times the staff member was pleasant and friendly. My suit was properly cleaned.  I would come here again for my other dry cleaning needs.
Big Mama,"Edna and Rosita are the best, they are the definition of professional and personable. Thanks for great customer service. Clothes always come back with great care."
Big Mama,"Edit: Business hours updated. Thank you for the great service!  Suddenly imposed a lunch break without informing the customers. The info is not updated on Google, and they are not picking up calls. You will only find out when you visit the store and greeted by a closed shutter. Pls update your operating hours across all your channels."
Red Holics,"We ordered a good for 2 pork cutlet tteokbokki but it was good for 3 people as well, original flavor, and half and half chicken. Really enjoyed it and we were full. Our seat was a little dark though haha, but ambiance was nice."
Red Holics,Authentic Korean restaurant that serves homely food that is good for big groups; both food and service are excellent.
Red Holics,"Had lunch here during a Sunday afternoon. I rarely eat Korean cuisine so I am not sure whether it's authentic or not. Ordered beef brisket with level 2 spicy. Overall the taste is good for me. The portion can feed up to 3 pax, a bit too much for 2 persons. Quite full but a bit boring towards the end because all the ingredients are rice cake related and noodles. Great and friendly staff! Food served in a short period."
Red Holics,"Ordered a crispy chicken rose tteokbokki, a half-half chicken, a flying fish roe rice, a seaweed roll and two bottles of soju which was just nice for 5 of us.  Tteokbokki was nice and chewy, and had a good variety of ingredients, but level 2 is really not spicy - would recommend to try level 3 instead.  Chicken was quite disappointing for me because it seems to be frozen chicken bites and was quite fatty.  My favourite was the flying fish roe rice which was really delicious! But could probably be replicated pretty easily at home haha.  Had higher expectations and meal was not cheap, so 3/5"
Red Holics,"Had a pleasant experience dining at Red Holic! Chanced upon this eatery as we were walking down Tanjong Pagar Road, looking for options. Decided to give this place a try as the menu looked interesting, and we weren’t disappointed!  Food was tasty and strong in flavour, we ended up getting more than we initially ordered. Staff were rather friendly and helpful, would probably give this place another go if we’re in the area, considering how crowded it can get especially on the weekend! :)"
Don Dae Bak,"The food is not bad, we tried the buffet and kimchi pancake. Up to standard. Marinated beef was quite nice.  One thing makes me won’t go back after all, the foreign worker waiter! His attitude is so awful, with lackadaisical serving style and the “owing him money” type of facial expression. A big big discount to the dining experience.  Want Dae Bak is better, but difficult to book and no lunch hours."
Don Dae Bak,"The quality of the food we had, particularly the pork, was absolutely exceptional. The succulent and flavorful taste of the grilled meat left us craving for more. It was evident that great care had been taken in sourcing high-quality ingredients and ensuring their preparation was done with expertise. The combination of flavors and the overall taste surpassed our expectations. Thank you!"
Don Dae Bak,"Great Korean BBQ, with excellent meat, beer and soju. We enjoyed the meat platter with beef and pork and had our grill changed 3 times to keep the cooking clean and smokeless. The service was very sharp and fast, and for any need, the staff was attentive and prompt. The kimchi was truly excellent!"
Don Dae Bak,"Love love this this place! Not the best for customer service but love the value you get. The lunch buffet is a good price and good options. We love the marinated soy pork collar and chicken. The pork belly and brisket are also really good and the beef bulgogi is one super tasty too. Meat quality it’s the best. It it’s not all fat so I would say it’s good value. Since they have expanded to the shop next door and the other locations the service has really gone down but if you can ignore that you will enjoy your food. Need to book early as they get super busy for dinner. Lunch is usually open and after 10pm no issues to walk in. We also love the fried chicken (didn’t get today) but it’s one of the best in Singapore too. Lastly, this is one of the few places that has real charcoal which adds to the flavor. They will change out the cooking plates every 15min or so depending on how much char has built up. This is our favorite…love DDB!"
Don Dae Bak,"Korean restaurant in Chinatown . Authentic . Great for gatherings . Noticed they are short handed . Despite that , the servers did their best to accommodate the requests of the guests . Monday dinner - 75% capacity . Popular with the young crowd .charcoal grill . The servers did not help with grilling meats . The ala carte meat sets were on the pricey side  eg $120 for 2 or 3 people- good quality though  . The fried chicken was juicy and tender . However the seafood pancake was thick and filling - did not sit well with me . It could be my personal preference .  Would suggest the buffet sets subject to a 90 minute eating time . Parking was limited to the Community centre just across the road . The maxwell mrt station ( exit 3 ) is just 2 minutes walk away - super convenient ."
Don Dae Bak,First time trying as I was craving for Korean BBQ. About $90 for buffet for 2 pax with the cheese add-on. When we were seated there are not much crowd as we went quite early. Yet I feel the staff were a bit unwilling to serve. When asked for extra sauce etc they show a bit black face. That’s -1 star off. The other star deducted is for the lack of choices for beef. Basically there’s only 2 kind of beef available and 1 of them is limited. The only one available as free flow would be bulgogi. Overall can try if you are not a beef person. Their chicken and pork are nice.
Don Dae Bak,"Terrible experience at Downtown East DDB. Was there with my family yst for dinner(29th July, 540pm). We order the 4 pax BBQ Buffet, noodles and dumplings. 1. Service of your crew is terrible. I used to work in a restaurant as well and your staff is definitely not trained to serve. Bad attitude and not welcoming at all. No smile on faces. Especially this chinese-looking girl in blond at the front of house, avoiding eye contact since we stepped into the restaurant. She turned her head from us when she see my parents raising their hand for assistance. Another chinese guy which speaks mostly chinese, he did acknowledge my parents and told them to wait. However, he did not come back to us for assistance after. So why acknowledge?? 2. Condiments provided were pathetic little. We are just trying to get refill for chilli because we finished ours and NO ONE reacts to bell or raising of hands. 3. The bell in the restaurant is not helping. We needed assistance, and so we pressed the bell. NO ONE CAME TO OUR TABLE. We waited for at least a good 15mins-20mins to get this guy (tattoo on neck) to help us. Thank god, at least he is still considered professional. 4. Poor management in stores. No host, no cashier, no floor, no runner in this store. FYI- when we stepped in the restaurant, there weren't a lot of customer, its like 6-7 tables only? & we even encounter customer leaving the restaurant angrily without ordering because no one bother to attend to them. Definitely not worth the experience, and is very disappointing."
Don Dae Bak,First time dining. Crowded and packed. Lucky to get seat during dinner time. Food was served fast and efficient. Meat has a lot of variety to choose. Samgyetang soup taste very good.
Don Dae Bak,"Pricey. Each portion of protein is min $26++. Min order for BBQ is 2 portions which doesn’t work out when u want to order cooked food and BBQ.  Not a place for a regular dinner.  But other than that the food is pretty decent. Portion is big but it’s really not suitable for small family in my opinion.  I wanted variety but I’m forced to order all the big portions when there’s only 2 of us.  Maybe we came on Vday however on a Tuesday (but we were not celebrating), we witnessed 2 different couples walked out because no response from service staff."
Don Dae Bak,"Visited on 26 Mar 2023, and was at the downtown East branch for sunday dinner.. the side dishes are replenished readily and I do enjoy the kimchi, fried glass noodles, and fish cake. But most importantly the meats are particularly tasty, especially the pork and chicken :smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes:"
Gogi jip,"Soy marinated raw crab was delicious! Worth trying if you have never tried something like this before, downside is just quite expensive for a small portion ($78 for 3 crabs). Be sure to try it together with rice as it might be a lil salty for some. 3.5/5  Cold noodle was pretty okay, tasted refreshing and had a big portion, gave us 2 small slices of meat too ?? 3.5/5  Seafood pancake was soft and fluffy, would give it a 4/5  Ordered black pork belly, very average, felt a little dry but still, it was not bad. 3.5/5  We (3 pax) spent around $200+ and felt very full, Would come back again if there’s promotion!"
Gogi jip,"The place to go in the Korean lane for soy sauce or chili marinated crabs!! I came with my friends under their recommendation for the marinated crabs. The crabs did not disappoint! It was a bit spicy even though it was the soy sauce marinated ones. I like that they provide gloves and you can keep your hands clean. I would recommend to order a bowl or rice to share. 1/3 bowl of rice is good for one crab. For the soft inner shell, use your hands to squeeze out the meat and roe. Mix with rice and enjoy! Without rice the marinate might be too salty. I also really like the variety of ban chan, you can ask for more when you’re done! The sweet potato was a favorite. We also got the beef rib tips - very nice and tender, just the right amount of fats. The pork collar was a bit too dry for me. Beef intestines were interesting and an acquired taste. I liked that the staff will help you cook the meats. There’s also lettuce to wrap the meats so you get some vegetables. The seafood pancake was tasty but abit soggy in terms of texture. Chestnut makgoli is a great addition to the meal! Make your reservation via WhatsApp, the store is very busy. You also only get two hours per seating. Happy to visit again for the marinated crabs."
Gogi jip,One of my highlight here is the free ice cream that customers can choose from different flavours. I recommend the melon flavour.  I also tried the spicy raw crab for the first time. It was great!  Food is delicious. Service is great too.
Gogi jip,Soy marinated crab is good - ask not to have cut chilli on top if you can’t take spicy. Intestines are good but very fatty; might be better to share among three people.
Gogi jip,"After all the hype, my sis and I decided to try the fermented soy crab. It just didn’t hit the spot for us… We couldn’t even finish half of the crabs because of the fermented smell/taste. the crabs tasted really sweet though - if you try really hard to search deep within your neural pathways! I would say it’s acquired taste.  However, The squid and ginseng chicken soup were fantastic! If you’re hesitating to try the raw marinated crabs - go for it. You might like it better than us. Also, life is too short not to try!"
Todamgol,"Came here for a friend's birthday lunch and the food is really good. The food is indeed traditional Korean and well plated too. It is slightly pricey, portion is just nice. They have refillable side dishes as with any other Korean restaurants. The BBQ items we ordered were cooked in the kitchen and served to us, so there was no cooking done by us and not smoky like other kbbq places."
Todamgol,Absolutely delicious authentic Korean food. Come in groups of 3-4 as portions as quite big! Love how the Maekgoli is poured out in a bowl and served with a spoon. There is unlimited free flow of small dishes too!
Todamgol,"I had a yoga class in the next building but couldn't go to the class. Instead I came Todamgol to eat Korean food lol  I took me a while to choose a menu because they have extensive options. When I finally chose, I was informed that the menu is not available :grinning_face_with_sweat:  The night I visited. The restaurant was short staffed so it took a while. The food was ok. For a solo diner, I liked the seating they gave me beside the window."
Todamgol,"My friends and I really enjoy the Korean dish Andong Jimdak very much. Finally after much searching, we have found this restaurant that serves our favourite Korean dish. We have come back to the restaurant whenever we crave for some good Andong Jimdak. The steamed egg, ramyeon, kimchi pancakes, braised pork trotter and BBQ meats are delicious too. The restaurant is also generous with its good variety of side dishes. Great place to have Korean food over soju and beer with good friends."
Todamgol,"The food and portion really nice and big:thumbs_up:. The small dishes are very nice. I would give :hundred_points: to their excellence service too. The environment is very Korean feel, like eating at Korea."
Sin Man Bok,"Food here was acceptable. Ordered the buffet set $31++ per person. Free flow- pork only. 1 steam egg for each table, 1 soup for 1 table- No matter how many ppl sitting at the table. Army stew was mediocre. Amount of noodles were only at most 2 mouth for each person. If ask for top up noodle need $5 additional cost… Fried chicken was nice. Each person only has 2 if ordered as buffet.  Service- I believed that there is a lack of staff, and the service was very poor. Asking questions and checking with them things, they get annoyed or they will say oh you ask the other person instead… And then the person hides behind the counter and when u approach her she says she will come to u later…  Side dishes and pork is free flow, but getting their attention to help you with it is another thing, cos they are forever occupied or behind the counter.  If you are ok with bad service but good food, then can try this place. For me I’m already working everyday dealing with people with attitude issues, but on my off day also have to deal with these service staff, sorry next please."
Sin Man Bok,"The service here was really top notch. There’s a Korean couple + two service guys on the floor that are really proactive and attentive with their service of food, drinks, meats, without needing to ask. Food wise, the fried chicken was nice, kimchi rice and kimchi soup was so-so. Nothing special. I’ll come back for the variety of free sides and the great service."
Sin Man Bok,"Friendly servers. Ordered kimchi soup noodles and pork cutlet. noodles were cooked to perfection and soup hot and flavourful. My favourite was the pork cutlet. Asked for gravy to be on side. Cutlet was crispy, tasty and generous portion. i love the gravy. would surely come back for this dish. Boss gave a complimentary steamed egg. Very nice. thanks boss!  Highly recommended!"
Sin Man Bok,"Grub :cut_of_meat: :cut_of_meat: :cut_of_meat: Dricka :beer_mug: :beer_mug: :beer_mug: :beer_mug: Price :kitchen_knife: :kitchen_knife: :kitchen_knife: Vibes :red_paper_lantern: :red_paper_lantern: :red_paper_lantern: :red_paper_lantern: Service :person_bowing: :person_bowing: :person_bowing: :person_bowing: Parking :P_button: :P_button: :P_button: Overall :trophy: :trophy: :trophy: :trophy:  Unique hot plate of cheese rice, BBQ and soup all in one. Cold noodles and pancake as usual standard fare. Good table size and largely comfortable seating for families or gatherings. I just like the lighting here actually."
Sin Man Bok,"The meat quality was really low and the servers don’t really know how to cook the meat well. They throw the whole portion of meat on the stove and walked away, coming back only after a long while. The meat became tough and dry. The marinated meat lack flavour and is really poorly seasoned. Spoke to the manager that the food is bad and she offered some discount as a form of service recovery. Unlikely to visit there again as there are many better choices at the same price point."
Sin Man Bok,A super value for money bbq buffet. The meat was pretty decent for the price. The steam egg was good. The pancake was a missed. The kimchi stew was a missed too. The noodles and fried chicken were not bad. Highly recommend to try if you are in the area. Do come earlier to avoid the dinner crowd if not it's a little hard to get their attention.
Sin Man Bok,"We recommend the $27++ buffet. At first, we were disappointed that only 4 meat items were free flow, and for the remaining 15 items, we could only choose 5 items, and these were not free flow. However, the serving was large, and after the first serving, we had a problem finishing the food. Food was generally good (but nothing outstanding) and punched its weight above the price tag. Overall, a pleasant surprise find for our first visit."
Sin Man Bok,"Great food and meat. Would definitely recommend the sirloin steak which is seasoned very well. The meat is of quite good quality and is marinated well such that it is extremely flavourful. However, the place was abit smoky due to some tables not having ventilation chutes."
Sin Man Bok,"Good Korean meal. Just that after every order of fresh new items, it takes so long to send to us, by that time we are so tired and lethargic. Then they never change the grill, it got so black at one point. When we ask them, they just ignore. Sad, the food was good. Just the experience was not very pleasing"
Sin Man Bok,"$27++ for buffet. A lot of dishes included. Kimchi Pancake is surprisingly good, one of the best we have eaten we were impressed! Not many meat selection but that’s alright, we were satisfied with the ones available. Staffs were friendly and attentive, changed the cooking hot plate without us prompting."
Wang Dae Bak,"Ordered the pork set and a half/half pancake for sharing.  There was 3 flavours/parts of pork and nothing tasted unusual or exceptionally special, it’s tasty though. Generous serving of lettuce to go with the grilled meat!  The pancake so far was the best I have ever tried, thin and crispy on the side and delicious, though a bit oily. Service was fast and generally good."
Wang Dae Bak,"Was shockingly unpleasant. Reserved a table for 7 pm, and when we arrived early 2 minutes before, we were told to wait. It was not a problem, but there was no proper waiting place. When he came to show us our table, 10 minutes later, the first thing that he told us was to leave by 8.30pm. When we were shown to our table, the table was unclean. Cold dishes appeared to be eaten or left behind by earlier customers, table and cutlery was also stained. Throughout the meal, we had to catch their attention as they appeared to be short staff. We've been to the branch at Holland Village, and it is such a vast difference."
Wang Dae Bak,"Great Korean cuisine! BBQ meat is nice, pork is a little too oily and salty though. The spicy seafood tofu soup is also great, slightly spicy (for those who can’t take spicy)."
Wang Dae Bak,"Yummy KBBQ! First time here and the ambience is really dope, food was yummy with FREE FLOW SIDE DISHES, TEA (!!!) & they’ll refill the egg on the wok too :smiling_face_with_heart-eyes::smiling_face_with_heart-eyes::two_hearts::winking_face_with_tongue::winking_face_with_tongue: bad an amazing dinner with friends and catchup :purple_heart::smiling_face_with_open_hands: we would def come back for their chicken platter & seafood pancakes &&&& we also really liked their rice cake :South_Korea::North_Korea::chopsticks: Just a tad bit expensive but worth the try!"
Wang Dae Bak,"One of the better Korean BBQ restaurants around with good quality of meat. Appreciate that they take in reservation despite the busy location. One thing that surprised me was the mushroom set which was $9, given the portion I think it is way too expensive, you are better off ordering just the meat."
Wang Dae Bak,"My friends and I ordered the 3-4 pax meal. It includes chicken (spicy and non spicy), pork, one large soup of your choice and half half pancakes (kimchi & seafood). The meat was juicy and we love the army stew!! The staff were very attentive too. We cooked the meat ourselves but the staff helped us to change the grill thrice."
Wang Dae Bak,"We ordered the Soul Meat set meant for 3-4 people. For 4 adults with moderate appetite, the portion was good and the variety was excellent. The set came with chicken and pork barbeque (each done two ways), a half-half pancake (2 flavours in one pancake) and a stew of your choice. We found the price of $128++ very reasonable for the quantity, quality and variety offered in one set. Other reviewers have also mentioned the kimchi, which was very fresh tasting with a good balance between the sour and spice tingling in your mouth.  Service was also fantastic. The service staff were prompt, efficient and yet friendly. Even though the restaurant was crowded and fully booked (weekend night), we did not feel pressured by the staff to rush our meal. They also cooked the meat for us, which was a pleasant surprise given how busy the restaurant was.  All in all, an excellent choice if you are looking for some Korean food in Singapore!"
Wang Dae Bak,"I made reservation based on previous reviews, and good thing I did since it was packed on a Sunday night at 7 pm for a table for two. Service was pretty good and just had to scan a QR code to order and ring the buzzer if or when you want to order something. I ordered two servings of pork belly, us prime steak, and mix mix pancake which is half kimchi and half seafood. The side dishes came out first and wasn’t quite what I was expecting, the kimchi didn’t look fresh and so did a couple of other ones, and we didn’t ask for refills… I realized no one there were Korean, but knew a few Korean phases which was interesting. I was able to grill the meat for us which is what I prefer when I eat KBBQ and they didn’t mind. They switched out the grill when I asked. The pork belly was on the thin side, so cooked very fast even with the grill temperature on low. It had a good crispy taste. The us prime steak also cooked fast and some nice tender bites and some chewy bites too. At the end, went to the restaurant to wash my hands but there were no paper towels or hand dryer."
Wang Dae Bak,Feel like in Korean with all the decor. I had lunch there and found out most of them has hot food while we are the only table having grills in the afternoon lol.  Food - meats are fresh and tasty. - loads of variety. - side dishes are average. There are much better ones - love their hot food too. Alway wanted to eat army stew but is always such a big portion. They have single portion. PERFECT.  Service - prompt and attentive
Wang Dae Bak,"Love this place! It has a nostalgic vibe & food & service are great as well! Brought my visiting friends from Europe & they love it too!  And we ordered far too much food & instead of letting it be, the service crew actually asked me to go through my order again & when we wanna order some rice or noodles to go along, the crew told us to hold on till we can finish what we have already ordered.  We managed to finish all the meats as it’s so good."
Wang Dae Bak,Surprisingly quiet for a Saturday night compared to their other outlets or even other restaurants downstairs bustling with customers. I found the staff here to be more helpful and polite than the other outlets. Presentation and food quality is notably better as well. This might be my outlet of choice moving forward. The staff offered to cook several times when I was juggling the thongs and scissors but I assured them we enjoyed the cooking process.  Our water was swiftly refilled and grills changed  before it burnt black. Definitely a good option if you find yourself without a reservation on a weekend in Holland Village.
Wang Dae Bak,"The service at Wang Dae Bak was exceptional from start to finish. The staff greeted me with genuine warmth and attentiveness, ensuring that I felt welcomed and comfortable throughout my visit. They were knowledgeable about the menu and offered insightful suggestions, making it easier for me to navigate the wide variety of options available. The food was served promptly, and the servers were always ready to assist with any requests or inquiries. The attentive service added an extra layer of enjoyment to the overall experience."
Wang Dae Bak,"Wang Dae Bak has delicious 𝙒𝙚𝙚𝙠𝙙𝙖𝙮 𝙇𝙪𝙣𝙘𝙝 𝙎𝙚𝙩𝙨 and we had a chance to feast on some of them :blue_heart::purple_heart: Standouts for us were definitely the 𝙎𝙩𝙚𝙖𝙢𝙚𝙙 𝙋𝙤𝙧𝙠 𝘽𝙚𝙡𝙡𝙮 𝙎𝙚𝙩 ($21). The pork belly :pig_face: was the epitome of 𝙢𝙚𝙡𝙩-𝙞𝙣-𝙮𝙤𝙪𝙧-𝙢𝙤𝙪𝙩𝙝 served with perfectly cooked pot rice :cooked_rice: Every mouthful was equal parts sinful and delicious, we definitely recommend this!. What’s more, lunch sets here come with 𝙧𝙚𝙛𝙞𝙡𝙡𝙖𝙗𝙡𝙚 𝙗𝙖𝙣𝙘𝙝𝙖𝙣!  The 6 𝙥𝙘 𝙨𝙣𝙤𝙬 𝙘𝙝𝙚𝙚𝙨𝙚 𝙛𝙧𝙞𝙚𝙙 𝙘𝙝𝙞𝙘𝙠𝙚𝙣 ($16) also exceeded our expectations with how juicy and crispy :poultry_leg: it still was! The snow cheese was a delightful mix of sweet and salty. We also tried their 𝙨𝙢𝙖𝙡𝙡 𝙥𝙖𝙣𝙘𝙖𝙠𝙚𝙨 ($5 𝙛𝙤𝙧 2) perfect for solo diners, but the pancakes are so good you’ll probably wanna get the full sized ones :face_holding_back_tears:  We also enjoyed: 𝘽𝙪𝙡𝙜𝙤𝙜𝙞 𝘾𝙤𝙢𝙗𝙤 𝙎𝙚𝙩 (𝘽𝙚𝙚𝙛 𝘽𝙪𝙡𝙜𝙤𝙜𝙞 𝙖𝙣𝙙 𝙆𝙞𝙢𝙘𝙝𝙞 𝙎𝙤𝙪𝙥) ($19) 𝘽𝙧𝙖𝙞𝙨𝙚𝙙 𝙋𝙤𝙧𝙠 𝙎𝙝𝙤𝙧𝙩 𝙍𝙞𝙗𝙨 ($19) 𝘿𝙤𝙡𝙨𝙤𝙩 𝙋𝙤𝙧𝙠 𝘽𝙞𝙗𝙞𝙢𝙗𝙖𝙥 ($17)  Follow us on IG @toofoodtomiss for more exciting foodie content!"
Wang Dae Bak,"The basic of a korean restaurant is their Banchan, and their banchan is GOOD~ From the banchan, you can see the sincerity of what chef and restaurant want to bring to you. Even the most simple salad, they enhance it with their own special peanut sauce and touch up with fried lotus.  The soup stock use by majority of the other korean restaurant usually are pork or chicken broth, but here they are using seafood!  The kimchi tofu soup was well delivered with plenty of seafood in.  Will also recommend the butter soy fried chicken. They launched a smaller portion recently, good for small eater or smaller group.  The service is also good. Despite the restaurant was almost full, the waiters still work their best to go around checking if everyone is having enough banchan etc.  The only disappointment i have is that they have their beef bulgogi fry cooked too dry. My partner basically abandoned the dish. Otherwise, they deserve a 5 stars."
Wang Dae Bak,"I’ve had a very good experience here before, but when we went today and got our tteok, it was clearly freezer burnt. All the pieces were cracked like this one and tough. If I’m paying $15 for rice cakes, I’d hope for fresh, but at the very least expect decent ones.  Update: restaurant sent us vouchers to make up for the experience. We got BBQ and it was AMAZING."
Tanjong Hwaro,"Tanjong Hwaro provides a decent Korean BBQ experience with some highlights, notably the Seafood Pancake. It's a good spot for smaller groups looking for an authentic, no-frills Korean BBQ meal.  Snapshot of our experience: - Beef Set B which contains: (Part of set) Short-rib boneless: A staple of any Korean BBQ, this dish provided an authentic taste, though it didn't particularly stand out. (Part of set) Beef Brisket: A classic choice for BBQ lovers, it was enjoyable but nothing too memorable. (Part of set) Marinated Beef Rib: These ribs were good, but an unfortunate overcooking incident was promptly addressed by the staff - a plus point for their service. (Part of set): Other items like Soup and Gyeran Jjim (standard, with the steamed eggs being less fluffy than usually expected). - Seafood Pancake: Surprisingly, this was the highlight of the options we'd ordered! The pancake was perfectly cooked, and the balance of flavors between the seafood and dough made it an absolute delight.  Service was satisfactory, and it was commendable that they acknowledged their mistake and replaced the overcooked meat without any fuss.  However, a word of caution for larger parties: table size could be an issue. For a comfortable dining experience, a group of 3-4 is recommended, as the space tends to get cramped with all the food and drinks."
Tanjong Hwaro,First Korean BBQ experience for the kids. Food and service was good with service staff cooking all bbq food. Best for 4 to max 5 ppl per table give size or table.
Tanjong Hwaro,"The meat tasted great and went well with the veggies and condiments.  However, the Banchan was super lacking and you had to pay for Barley water at $4 a jug, no normal water.  Service was ok, complimentary yoghurt drink that came after the meal.  Overall very very average, not worth the price point considering there are so many other Korean places around."
Tanjong Hwaro,Good quality meat ( we chose the premium meat set) and the staff is promptly come to prepare for us and the banchan is yummy too Overall it’s a good place if you want your k bbq meat fix and very crowded if you come after 630pm and good that we arrived just after 6pm  :thumbs_up:
Tanjong Hwaro,"I recently dined at this Korean BBQ spot and was impressed by the value-for-dollar set menu, which included a great variety of meats and sides. The food was delicious, cooked to perfection, and really hit the spot. On top of that, the service was top-notch and really made the experience exceptional. The staff were friendly, attentive. They do need to work on their ability to.communicate in English with customers.  The only recommendation I would make is for the staff to receive training on separating cooked and uncooked food while cooking at the table. While the meal was thoroughly enjoyable, it would enhance the overall experience and address any potential sanitary concerns. With that being said, I would still recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a delicious and affordable meal that doesn't skimp on quality."
Kim Dae Mun,"Bad, definitely not authentic Korean food.  Both the quality of ingredients (in my case beef, kimchi) and the taste is terrible.  I seldom cannot finish my food but I really cannot. The Kimchi is so so sour.  The beef is like leather of shoes.  The soup taste like MSG powder.  Definitely will forget this shop."
Kim Dae Mun,"Comfort food at a reasonable price, nestled within the CBD. Food is of a sufficiently high quality. However, when compared to other similar establishments, the price can be a little steep. The eatery itself is air-conditioned, but be prepared to leave smelling like oil and smoke. (That’s the true Korean food experience!)"
Kim Dae Mun,"A favourite place for more affordable Korean food. Ginseng chicken soup ($15) is thick and rich, generous amount of ginseng in the sticky rice. Spicy beef soup ($10) comes with glass noodles and plenty of veges. Chive pancake ($4.50) was crispy. Will return over and over again!"
Kim Dae Mun,"My first experience at Kim Dae Mun a decade ago wasn't the best but I decided to give it a 2nd chance. I'm glad I did.  Kim Dae Mun is a Korean food restaurant run by a Korean family. It's more of a food court concept where you queue up to order at their counter, make payment and wait to collect your food. They offer a variety of authentic Korean dishes from Korean hot plates, noodles, rice dishes, stew and more. Prices are affordable too. Worth checking out!  I ordered Bibimbap (1 pork and 1 beef) , Chives Pancake and a Beancurd soup.  :chopsticks: Bibimbap ($10) - a rice dish topped with assorted fresh and flavorful veges, including carrots, spinach, mushrooms, bean sprouts etc, as well as a protein of our choice. The Bibimbap was delicious and authentic, generous portion and a great mix of flavors and textures. Extra sauces provided to enhance the flavor.  :chopsticks: Chives Pancake ($4.50) - Sharable between 2 pax. Popular Korean appetizer made with a batter of flour, eggs, and fresh chives for that extra fragrance. The pancake was pan-fried till golden brown, served with a soy dipping sauce which adds a nice balance of salty and savory flavor. The pancake had a crispy outer layer while still remain moist and chewy on the inside. No wow factor, average dish but worth a try as a nice appetizer to start off your meal.  :chopsticks: Beancurd Soup ($9.50) - Sharable between 2 pax. Non spicy soup, contains generous amount of Tofu and seafood like claims and squid. Soup was light yet flavourful and slightly on the sweet side from the seafood. Did not feel thirsty after drinking, which was great! If you prefer a spicy and bolder taste, I would recommend their kimchi soup instead.  *For sets, Kim Dae Mun offers a complimentary choice of banchan (side dish) of Kimchi, stir fry spicy anchovies or spicy cucumber salad.  Overall, authentic and homely atmosphere with quick and friendly service. The only down side is the slight smoky stench lingering on your clothes, which happens whenever you are at any Korean BBQ place."
Kim Dae Mun,Authentic Korean food from mom's recipe- over several decades from mom's generation to daughter's now - always best 육개장YukGaeJang(beef spicy soup) served!! Amazed all the time at the owners dedicated to Authentic Korean food consistently at very reasonable price!! After exhausted tour you should have this spicy soup육개장 for refreshing!!! Great Appreciation to these owners- mom&daughter!!!
Three Meals A Day,"This is one of the go to restaurant if I have craving for Korean food. Considering the portion, the prices are reasonable. We had 2 main course plus another kimchi pancake. We didn’t manage to finish the pancake as there was just too much food. For the first time I ordered the pork cutlet rice (can’t remember the name on Korean). The gravy is really unique, it had the taste of tomato yet it looks like curry. The portion is huge. Service is really good. I would definitely come back again. Highly recommended"
Three Meals A Day,Korean cuisine is never my preference unless someone with you know what to order. Tried this eatery near beauty world. It was crowded and long line of people queuing for a table. Good to book your table. Ordered 4 dishes and all turned out good. The fried chicken and the hot pot stew are good and match well with beer. Never disappointed.
Three Meals A Day,"The seafood pancake is good. I highly recommend it. The pork kimchi soup also warms the stomach on a cool day for me (I was there on a day that rains non-stop). The mixed fried chicken is a bit hit and miss. It is also a bit too much for 2 pax. If I were to choose again, I would skip the fried chicken and go for other dishes. Restaurant can be busy during weekday lunch time, I strongly encourage to call and make reservation to avoid waiting time."
Three Meals A Day,"Very delicious and authentic Korean restaurant to dine at.  The side dishes were delicious, especially the ikan bills, beanspouts and macaroni. The seafood ramyeon was good too! Very comforting The fried mandu was crispy on the outside and tender on the inside The beef bulgolgi was my favourite. The beef was tender and the taste was perfect The iced honey ginseng drink was refreshing. The taste of honey wasn't very strong, but there was a nice ginseng attertaste"
Three Meals A Day,"Been here a couple of times and it has never failed to satisfy my (k)ravings :squinting_face_with_tongue: It has a wide selection of authentic korean food, from kimbap to beef galbi to jjajang myeon to kimchi stew - you name it. So far, everything I've tried has been great and this explains the constant queue outside the restaurant. Average waiting time is around 30-60mins usually.  Ran by a super friendly ahjumma, service was quick and our food was served within 10-15mins upon ordering."
Three Meals A Day,"As good as the original in Sim Lim. Could always do with more salted egg sauce ;p Late in the game; didn’t know they had a branch in my friendly neighbourhood, Hougang (has been for 2 years I was told).  Take note that this dish (and many others) are available only from 11am. And they have an afternoon break from 3.30-4.30pm. Don’t just anyhow go like me hor."
Three Meals A Day,"First time trying this shop after my friend recommendation. Located within the HDB block at Hougang Blk 121 with limited tables. Ordered their pan fried bee Hoon, salted egg chicken with rice and yang Zhou fried rice. Personally I feel its a pretty average zhi char shop. Fried rice was alittle too wet and no wok hei, pan fried been hoon was like a deep fried bee hoon with the vegetables and meat was over cooked and not much ingredients."
Three Meals A Day,"Clean and comfortable environment, with plenty of fans, the place is really cooling without air-con.  The butter chicken rice and creamy salted egg chicken rice were delish, yolks were runny and complimented the whole dish really well.  We had the san-low beehoon and sweet potato leaves, there was wok hei taste, yum!  Will come back again to try the sambal BBQ dishes!"
Three Meals A Day,"Ate at this place for the 2nd time last week. Portions were so-so, and salted egg pork ribs rice were ok but imo a little over rated. The first time I ate MHK here I didn’t really have a good impression on the quality. Overall just a place to satisfy your hunger pangs I suppose"
Three Meals A Day,"Had the San lou bee hoon, qinglong chai, claypot tofu and the fried pork belly. All the dishes were very good. My favorite was the bee hoon and the fried pork. Service was quick and efficient."
Three Meals A Day,"This is the definition of Good and Affordable Food! They serve a really high quality & decent sized meals at very low price. I ordered the Salted Egg Fried Chicken with Egg and tried their crispy noodle on my next visit. Both are really good, but my favourite so far is the Salted Egg Fried Chicken with its unique taste. The owner is super friendly and goes out her way to greet the customers (and her regulars). I will be back to try their other menus (or to repeat my salted egg fried chicken). Tips: Order With Egg and flip the egg around and crush the yolk so that it is all over your rice!"
Three Meals A Day,"Saw really long queues and a crowded shop when I passed by so I decided to try their food for a lunch on a weekday, thinking the crowd would be thinner. I was wrong. The queue was even longer.  There are 2 queues to dine in. First you have to order your food, then carry the marker stand to join the queue for tables. So far in both my visits, I have managed to get a table under 10 minutes.  On to the food, the salted egg chicken rice is freaking delicious. So was the butter cream pork chop. I generally recommend trying food based on their original flavours but their chilli really elevates the dish. Be sure to grab some to try if you are here!"
Three Meals A Day,"I came early and the queue was short, once you made the order then you can proceed to find your seat.  Once seated, waiting for the food to come takes time.  The salted egg rice was nice, a bit too sweet but its okay. The chicken was a bit chewy. It was really nice to have them with the sunny side egg"
Three Meals A Day,"Come here around 4 PM. The place doesn’t seems very special, but once you entered, you’ll notice their friendliness right away.  We’ve heard a lot about how good their salted is and we try their chicken salted egg rice and pork rib salted egg rice. With extra sunny side up for sure.  The taste is indeed amazing! I love the pork rib salted egg better than the chicken version. But both for sure are nice! A must visit place when in Singapore."
Three Meals A Day,hands down to the most comforting meal i had in singapore :smiling_face_with_hearts: their salted egg i know very popular. but have you guys tried their ginger onion fish? :weary_face::thumbs_up_light_skin_tone: cryyyyy it’s so so gewddd! pls give it a try! :face_savoring_food:
Um Yong Baek,Had a very satisfying meal! Food and service were top notch! Even help to cook the meat. So glad we managed to get a place before they close for walk-ins. At around 6:15pm they have already closed the counter for walk in. So its best to come way early around 530pm. We really enjoyed the aged pork collar. It was so juicy and tender! Everything was great!
Um Yong Baek,"Went here for lunch, very systematically, get a queue number and head down. Kinda tough cause they start at 11.. so either go early or time it right I guess. But very fair system.  Easy place, 1 set of menu for lunch and another for dinner. And the internal decors were very nice.  Got the pork collar broth soup, feels very healthy, so prob not for anyone expecting something very heavy but just very hearty and the pork was really good. Also order the pork on the side which was really simple and good, goes very well with the sauce.  Can I highlight how good their kimchis are? Especially the cabbage one! Not a big fan of sour one but this is perfect, apparently is freshly made.  On another note, probably the price point for lunch is really steep for what you're getting. Might be quality pork, might no novelty but what do I know?  Also heard dinner is good, the BBQ, will be back."
Um Yong Baek,So glad we got to try the soup today! The queue system is a little stressful to work around - requires some planning if you’re not working nearby but overall not toooo difficult to navigate. Loved the “thicker” soup with the chives (Milyang?) - the “lighter” one from Busan was also really good. Absolutely loved the pork belly platter (not cheap though it was $45 while the soups were about $20+) Loved their side dishes too - I believe they served chives kimchi and the usual cabbage kimchi. We also got the pollack roe which was also a nice way to add some saltiness to the meal.
Um Yong Baek,"Best Korean BBQ I have ever had! Although the menu seems limited, but what they offered is superb! Fantastic Whole Neck Tenderloin! The experience is like fine dining which they grill for you and provide different combinations to taste the tenderloins. Absolutely 5 stars!"
Um Yong Baek,Came here for lunch which doesn’t accept reservation and only online queue system. Logged in at 10am and there’s already 28 people before me. Shop opens at 11am and Managed to get seated at closed to 12  There are only two pork soup rice for lunch menu - I ordered milyang pork soup rice… the soup was pretty bland and I can’t really taste the pork but must say the pork is pretty premium quality. But for $21 I expected a lot more… feel this place is overrated and definitely overpriced (at least for lunch)…not really sure what’s the hype :woman_shrugging_light_skin_tone:  Won’t recommend for lunch  Two stars - one for premium pork and one for the vibe
Genki Sushi,Convenient location to satisfy sushi cravings. The portion of teriyaki chicken don is smaller. My first try to order salmon soup — not nice and not fresh. The rest is okay :) although sushi wrap can be better.
Genki Sushi,"My favourite sushi place! I’ve tried other sushi chains but they are just not as delicious. Genki is on the pricier side comparing to others, which I personally do not mind at all. There is always queue so do be prepared to wait a little while. It gets busier during dinner so service might be slower at times."
Genki Sushi,"My first time after my last visit more than 10 years ago to their branch at Chinatown Point.  The food being served on a mini train running on a conveyor belt was still in use today & appreciated by us all who have eaten at Genki Sushi!  There's a good variety of handrolls and maki.  The staff was very nice to highlight this to me when I was about to order a second cup of green tea, not realising that it was refillable.  I enjoyed my dinner & the service was indeed impeccable!  I also bought their green tea.  Highly recommended & I would definitely visit them again when I come to junction 8 again!"
Genki Sushi,"One of my favourite places to go for decent reasonably priced and good quality sushi. Usually draw crowds during dinner and on weekends, I tried this on a weekday lunch and there was no queue. It was a pleasant dining experience with very  cheerful and friendly staff. Sashimi wise is as fresh as usual and the bill comes out to be quite reasonable. Always enjoyed watching the rockets zooming past the tables and very efficient way to serve food and reducing labour. Would recommend visiting there for good Japanese sushi."
Genki Sushi,Good place great food  We ordered - Spicy Salmon Roll (recommended and must try) - Mini Gyu Don - Genki Sushi Roll - Mentai Roll - Volcano Roll
Genki Sushi,"There’s never too much sushi! Genki has always been our to go sushi place for a quick decent meal. Everything we ate so far has always been delicious, especially their aburi mentaiko salmon sushi! Pictures will do the job for my review here. Will continue to dine at Genki at any time again!"
Genki Sushi,":steaming_bowl: Food & Taste: One of the most disappointing Genki outlets. Their portion is much smaller and the food somehow does not taste as good as the other outlets. The first time I felt so dissatisfied having Genki (my favourite sushi place).  :round_pushpin: Place: The place is not too crowded during off peaks but during peak, the wait can be really long.  :person_in_tuxedo_light_skin_tone: Service: Quite bad.. The staff all seems to have some kind of attitude and unsure.  :money_bag: Price: Not cheap. The bill came up to be over $60 and it wasn’t a lot of food that we ordered. Probably because of the price increase.  :hatching_chick:Waiting Time: Reasonable. Was not very long but the food does not taste great."
Genki Sushi,"always a good experience dining at Genki Nex.  besides the usual aburi and mentai salmon sushi, genki roll etc, we tried their Hokkaido Festival which included Hotate Don and Mentai Thick Cut Hotate which were both delicious.  I’m unfortunately not able to appreciate the chawanmushi with cheese… I like it without cheese."
Genki Sushi,"My fave sushi store brand.. though I feel standard dropped abit. Overall still good for a mass chain sushi place, out of other brands."
Genki Sushi,"The worst dining experience in sushi place across Singapore. Several items order did not come, table next to us came later but the food were served. After checking with the Supervisor, a receipt were handed asking me to strike off those that came. BUT long waits after, it is still not served and the supervisor did not come back to check with me at all ;) What’s point of this? Solve your issue but half only :) crack an egg but? HAH half cracked. lol. ??"
Genki Sushi,"Need to wait awhile if its peak hours, need to take queue number and can walk around the nearby shops for awhile. When order, the food comes pretty fast. The sushi and sashimi is quite fresh and food taste good for the price we paid. Lots of options and there is promos ongoing, especially during weekdays, can check it out."
Genki Sushi,"Am pleased with the service, all the staffs are so nice. New mall so there will be some issue with the ordering system, its not the restaurant fault whereas the whole mall no network hence slow down the ordering process. I would like to specially commend their part timer staff, Sean, for his attentiveness and good service. Everyone is so helpful despite they are so busy handling the crowd."
Genki Sushi,"This item is on 1-for-1 promo. I was expecting a quick turnover for this item but it took reminders before i received my order. Since it is a hand-roll, the seaweed should be crispy. However, my order had such a soggy seaweed I had to spit out half of it."
Genki Sushi,Went there twice recently and had really good service both times. All of the staff had high standards in terms of politeness and attentiveness. Special shout out to Yang Han though for his initiative in helping us with the highchair/booster seat and also allowing us to change our seats because the air con was too cold. He was meticulous and even cleaned an area of the table twice because of a stain. Would really recommend to bring a jacket cos it's really coldddddd.
Genki Sushi,"1 star because it was impossible to dine in due the air con. Staff were very apologetic but say that nothing that they can do. The air con was directly blowing strongly down at the counter seats, making it too cold to eat. I probably need my winter clothings to dine there. Staffs quickly assisted to help me pack my food as my kids really couldn’t stand the cold. Really hope that the management can work with the building management to do something about this. Or add something to glide the air away."
Genki Sushi,"Personally think Genki Sushi is way better than Sushi Express. The selection is more, taste also slightly better. The sushi which recommended is the Spicy Salmon Roll, the crunchy tempura sprinkle on the top of the sushi roll, that’s the best topping :face_savoring_food: Second goes to Yakiniku Beef DMZ, big slices of beef lay on top of the sushi rice, so worth it!! Last recommended sushi goes to their latest sushi which is Calbee series, sound weird as in chip on the sushi but it wasn’t that bad :grimacing_face:"
Genki Sushi,"Today’s (28May2023) salmon is bad and not fresh, beef DMZ is cold.  Genki Roll is not even a roll and come as Nigiri style, and the soft-shell crab inside is soggy. The entire roll is collapsing, seem like the chef is not interested.  The salmon 3 flavour separated from the rice and one of it is toppled when it reached.  If I’m looking for this quality of food, I will just go to Sushi Express and not come Genki.  Dear Mgmt, please do conduct frequent quality checks.  Other than the bads, Chawanmushi is great, Spicy Salmon Temaki is great too. However didn’t want to add additional orders as afraid that other menu items may be bad quality like the beef and salmon. Don’t wanna be more disappointed."
Genki Sushi,"Arrived at this branch at Somerset at 7.40pm. Queued till 8.20pm. (Tues)  Prices have definitely gone up, the food doesn't seem to worth it's value.  Service was quite good, above average.  The taste was very mediocre if you ask me.  The wasabi was amateurish!  We ordered fries as well and it turned out disastrous.  Sweet with syrup and mayo!!?  The good n reliable thing was the green tea which we had direct access to the hot water for self refilling.  Overall,  5/10, and I doubt I will b back again.  I'd rather give a try to other sushi outlets.  (If the prices were lower, customers may be more forgiving)."
Genki Sushi,"Fresh sushi and sashimi, what’s not to love?  But the best part about Genki?  Their Mentaiko fries and sushi!"
Genki Sushi,"Arrived at the branch, took queue number, and lucky that the queue line wasnt that long as expected.  Food wise is bang average to be honest for the price we are paying because Genki isn't that cheap anymore. The taste of the food served are really very very average, and not nice. There are plenty of sushi outlets that are better, so please explore elsewhere."
Genki Sushi,3 pieces of Salmon sushi were really good. The mentai scallop was amazing too. Only ordered a few things but they were all fresh and tasty.
Genki Sushi,"Can only see 2 staffs at the front. 1 cashiering, the other clean table and serve customer. What happen? Its the weekend and you only have so few staffs?  Even the train derailed or the plate was not put properly on the train and it hit either the wall or the chair and it topple over the train (See photo of the derail train and topple of food)  Saw one external staff kicking the kitchen door loudly and scolding the kitchen staffs.  Whats going on to this outlet???"
Genki Sushi,Loved everything I tried on the menu - went multiple times during my very short trip!
Genki Sushi,"Can’t go wrong with sushi and mentaiko sauce. This outlet gets pretty crowded during dinner time, so be prepared to wait for some time. We ordered a couple of sushi and their signature mentaiko fries. Overall experience was quite ok. Just slightly awkward seating at this outlet."
Genki Sushi,"Long q on sun, small portion of food, good variety of food, but in terms of quality, sushiro is better."
Genki Sushi,"Food here is as good as most of the other outlets. Just that this place isn't as crowded, which was great. There's a waiter whom was quite loud in doing things. Like dumping the plates into the dirty dish trolley loudly and wiping the tables while you're still eating. We were there before 8pm so there's no rush? There weren't a lot of tables as well. Quite pressuring when a waiter does that. Food standard is still great so still in the higher star range"
Genki Sushi,"Currently my favorite sushi belt restaurant. My must order dish is their teriyaki beef. I usually order at least 4 plates each visit. Super delicious. Kids love the mentaiko fries, also worth ordering are the fried squid tentacles."
Genki Sushi,"Good food, decent pricing, and the cutest train tracks sending food to the table — there’s nothing to not love about Genki Sushi. This new outlet at United Sq is clean, brightly lit and their trains do not have to be ‘sent back’ with the push of a button after delivering the food.  Classics like their salmon trio, daimanzoku range will always be loved, and they also have new offerings like the Genki x Calbee collaboration. Incorporating well-loved Calbee snacks like Jagabee and the hot and spicy chips add texture and depth to Genki’s delicious sushi."
Genki Sushi,"One of the best genki outlets with great customer service by avyanne. She remembered our name cos we were the first to order the latest genki rich chocolate cake. We were impressed by her greetings, 'welcome back'. Thank you so much for making us feel the warmth coming into genki United square. Kudos to her and the team :)!"
Genki Sushi,"Newly opened outlet that is more spacious and with far better service than the others. The sashimi is fresh as always, and don’t forget to try the cheese mochi and mini yusheng (seasonal item for cny!). They’re currently giving away free sushi socks as part of their opening promotion, which are way too cute."
Genki Sushi,"By far the worse genki outlet I’ve been to. Service was bad from the start. Staff was inattentive and one of the staff saw us raising our hands but ignored and went to clear the table in front of us. The bowls that the noodles were served in were dirty, there was some kind of string in my soba, after finally getting the attention of the staff they offered to give me a new bowl of soba and this time when I was finishing my noodles I realised that there is rice in the bowl. My friends spoon for her udon also arrived dirty and my Beef DMZ was slightly burnt."
Genki Sushi,"Nice food, good service but the food delivery is a bit slow during lunch period"
Genki Sushi,"There is always a queue, but the queuing time is usually shorter than expected, maybe people give up when waiting for too long. Genki is one of the favourite sushi chain for my kids, I like their many mini rice, uson, soba meal. Suitable for family with young children"
Genki Sushi,Yumz my fav sushi place in Singapore - considering BOTH affordability AND quality!! (altho if price wasn’t a concern I’ll be at the sushi bar everyday!! :nerd_face:) Super loveeee the salmon belly!!! There’s a queue during peak hours (duh) but it moves very fast! Go at 5pm and there won’t be a queue. :bento_box::sushi::bento_box::sushi:
Genki Sushi,"Food standard have somewhat dropped. Quality is a little poorer than other outlets. For example, the sushi is poorly molded and very ""loose"", which meant ingredients fall out easily. Also, fried items are too oily.  Hope it improves as I generally like Genki Sushi for being fuss-free and above average.  For now, it's a 3 star."
Genki Sushi,"Consistent quality and service as usual.  Their new Gyu Inari is sweeter than expected due to inari + sweet beef. But nevertheless full of flavour and delicious!  Their maze soba (dry) is very chewy and delicious, infused with pickled radish flavour. Comes with 2 duck pieces and 3 bamboo shoots.  Their original mille crepe tastes nice, but maybe not my thing. Fresh whipped cream between spongy cake layers.  Just wish it was less pricey, and counter seats are not too close together."
Genki Sushi,"Really enjoyed our dining experience! Good food is hard to come by- fresh and value for money!!! We enjoyed our beef bowl , and the one for one tamago :) yummy"
Genki Sushi,"Their logo exactly depicts what we're feeling right now. Worst Genki experience ever in my whole entire life. Waited more than half an hour for a plate of mentaiko sauce, just to be ignored by 3 staff when I approached them. Our last dish (salmon 3 flavors) did not even arrive after an hour of wait. We decided to forgo the last dish but  our request to cancel the order was declined. Told the staff we dont want it anymore but he insisted that he cannot cancel. We had to wait for another few minutes for the dish.  If the kitchen is short handed, i feel sorry for you guys. The manager should look into this.  Overall, disappointed, but will come back to claim my member birthday perks."
Genki Sushi,"Squeezed the 2 of us in between 2 groups of diners when there are rows of empty seats behind. I asked to change seats but not allowed. In front of our seats has no chopstick tray, no saucer and no tissue box. The server served my green tea to the diner beside us and wanted to leave. Service sucks"
Genki Sushi,The food is tasty and acceptable given the price range. A good place to chill out and enjoy delicious Japanese food in city square mall.
Genki Sushi,The last time I was at a Genki we had to press a button to send the train back. Here the trains go back themselves. Food is not bad. The minimal service was also friendly - someone told us about the day’s special offer. Price wise it is the same as Sushiro but there’s more variety in terms of rice bowls and noodles.
Genki Sushi,":sushi: Food & Taste: The food all tasted good compared to the outlet at NEX. Adequate amount of sauce on everything. Felt satisfied after the meal.  :round_pushpin: Place: The place does not seem crowded on a weekday afternoon. It is located in the basement of Chinatown Point mall. Very quiet.  :person_in_tuxedo_light_skin_tone: Service: Not bad. The staff acceded to our request to sit at the more spacious table.  :money_bag: Price: Standard  :hatching_chick:Waiting Time: Reasonable. Was not very long since time is still needed for food to be prepared.  However, the dessert took awhile."
Genki Sushi,They recently moved to basement and the staff are so nice and attentively. Very clean environment. Sushi taste fresh and good. Okonomiyaki is superb! Easily one of my favourite sushi places for Japanese food cravings.
Genki Sushi,"Visited 31st July 2023, 7.19pm. Food was served very very slow, one by one each time. We had to wait for eternity and almost wanted to cancel the remaining orders. We will never return to this outlet anymore. During payment had to wait for the Assistant Manager to finish entertaining one customer at the cashier, making everyone else wait for payment.  After another eternity, Male staff Poh Heng then finally decided to step in to help Assistant Manager to settle payment from the waiting customers in snake queue."
Genki Sushi,Good sushi with monorail service. Wheeeeeee! Decent sushi served to diners via monorail from the kitchen . Reasonable prices. Fresh Order via QR CODE. Handicap :wheelchair_symbol: doable Restrooms :restroom: in the mall area about 50 meters away Ckean! Recommended
Genki Sushi,"Very disappointed with their food quality. We went for a late lunch on Sunday. I ordered Genki roll, Three way salmon and Salmon Belly. The salmon quality in the three way salmon was okay, but the two aburi salmon was overvooked and the mentai sauce was awful. For the genki roll, I did not like the combination of the ingredients, not sure what is inside as their online menu had no description of the dish. The salmon belly was good (perhaps it is because it is just fish and rice, no weird combo/sauces etc.). Food came pretty quick as it was non peak hour and staff are friendly. Sadly, I may not be back, plenty other better sushi joints in town."
Genki Sushi,"I think the service is great, the employees are really helpful and tries their best to help find seats for us during peak periods "
Genki Sushi,"we patronised this outlet last Friday on the 7th April, and the food was okay the usual, but the chicken hamburger (not in picture) was a little overcooked according to my sister. The customer service could also use some improvements, as this lady who if I'm not wrong, is a Filipino, reacted weirdly when we moved over from the other table, giving exaggerated reactions when we moved to our new table as being told by the other male Chinese staff member. The restaurant is also very squeezy."
Genki Sushi,Ice cream took very long to arrive (est 20 mins) and one of our friend has to go off. We ask for refund and they refuse to do a refund even when the ice cream has not yet arrived. Poor service and attitude from the staff. Super disappointing.
Genki Sushi,"The food portions are significantly smaller compared to other Genki Sushi. And the sushi feels like it was prepared half-assedly. The sushi just breaks and the roll seems to be smashed  We visit Genki Sushi very often, but this one is disappointing."
Genki Sushi,"For the money the food here is actually really good. Portion sizes are decent and quality is fresh as well. Not sure if it helped that we went on a Sunday 12 noon slot when we might have been having the best ingredients. The makimonos were really great as was the don. The peach ice cream with corn flakes is also not bad. Ended by taking membership, I can see us coming back often for comfort Japanese fast food."
Genki Sushi,Found a decent reasonably priced sushi as our go to place. The have good variety of sushi and daily specials. The salmon sashimi tasted ok but still can’t beat Taiwan’s sushi quality. Frozen thawed sashimi vs the ones in Taiwan which are freshly cut. Good to satisfy cravings for sushi if you don’t plan to splurge too much. Kids loved the place so can consider coming here again.
Genki Sushi,Hotate color totally off...horrible ordering system...food taste mediocre...cheap no doubt but I would rather pay more for better quality and portion. Similar lousy experience when we visited the junction 8 branch..sorry but not returning.
Genki Sushi,Good outlet but felt that the quality here is lower than the one at Bugis. Came on a weekday night and it was relatively fast to get seated and to get our food. Cooked food were hot. The bill came up to $60++  for 4 people. Satisfied with our visit here.
Genki Sushi,My kids loved their Chawan mushi and chewy udon. The new cheese mochi was nice too.  The salmon sashimi is fresh still like before.  Advice: Fried salmon skin - don’t order it’s like overly fried and really nothing much to eat into.
Genki Sushi,Food overall are quite nice. Download the app and sign up as members for perks and to help with getting queue number. Dining time is limit to 1 hour.
Genki Sushi,Simple no frills self service sushi place where food is served on a model shinkanshen :train: . Went early for lunch with a friend and was promptly seated without wait. Good range of options with set lunch for weekdays. Quite Satisfied :relieved_face: with our lunch and felt sleepy after.
Genki Sushi,"Nice choice of Japanese food delivered on a model Shinkansen (bullet/maglev train). :monorail: Items are reasonably priced.  Twice, items did not arrive until you remind the server to check on your order.  So do check that all your dishes have arrived and remind the servers if there is anything missing after a while.  Less crowded during lunch time.  You can download the app to get a one time discount and free item for new members. After you are a member you can get a queue number on the app instead of being there physically.  The system will sms you when there are 3 diners ahead of you, so you can shop around if there is a long queue."
Genki Sushi,"Visited this Outlet on 1/6/23. Was here happily to have dinner with my family. While we will called to go in , this staff ( Angela) had took us to a table ( 31 ) . Due to we have 5 paxs and request a bigger table. When we reach the table we realised the she took us to the wrong table. We then walk to the table ( 13 ) . This staff had started to show us an attitude with a very happy face . She ask another staff to check our receipt written table number. We told the staff that you guys had took us to the wrong table. Nevertheless, if you apologise on mistake we definitely forgive the mistake. Last but no least ( Angela had show us a very bad attitude against her mistake. Should Genki manager train their staff on right attitude on customer."
Genki Sushi,"Always enjoyed this place for sushi. There’s always a queue here so be patient. Take your queue, go shopping and then come back and have your meal. Lots of unique sushi from the usual suspects."
Genki Sushi,"Unagi was delicious (charred beautifully) and still hot after 10min Be careful bones. Reasonable price. Food serving is fast, and friendly staff. Would have given 5 stars, but saucer and cup not clean."
Genki Sushi,This outlet got to be one of the poorer ones in terms of food and serving duration. Food preparation looks rushed. I would expect more quality from a brand like Genki especially when I frequent other outlets.
Genki Sushi,"Visited the restaurant to satisfy the sushi craving. The restaurant here uses a queue system. During peak hours, there is usually a waiting time. The service here is quite fast and efficient. The food is prepared within a short period of time. One of the best tasting items is the unagi DMZ, it is just packed with flavour and the cheese inside of it tastes great. The salmon sushi is also nice tasting. Overall, the sushi is definitely delicious and is consistent in quality with the other branches. Definitely a great place to satisfy the craving!"
Genki Sushi,"Generally the food is still ok- pretty consistent with other branches.  However, this outlet seems to be extremely understaffed. Not sure why we are paying for service charge if we don’t even receive any proper service.  Another incident was that there was a missing item, but the staff did not seem to believe. To make things worse, when the spicy salmon sushi finally came, it was just full of sauce and there was only one tiny piece of salmon. Upon checking with the staff he just said oh it’s the same as the one we had initially which was obviously not.  Gengki sushi will really need to improve on their service level before I will come back again."
Genki Sushi,"Heard good things of the franchise, first time eating at Compass One outlet. Food and portions were alright, but shockingly oily and salty. Waited 20mins for 1 serving of soft cream"
Genki Sushi,"I visited this restaurant during lunch, and despite the crowd, I was pleased that there was no wait for seats. Take note that the food took quite awhile to arrive during this peak hour.  They offer 4 different lunch sets, and I opted for the Sushi & Soba set, which was reasonably priced at $12.90 (excluding taxes). The set included Cha Soba, 5 pieces of sushi, Gyoza, and buttered cup corn—all of which tasted delightful.  Although the Edamame was made from frozen rather than fresh ones, it was still enjoyable. The highlight was the Hotate Mentaiko sushi, which was on a 50% promotion at $1.80 per piece. The scallop was fresh and tender, making it a worthwhile choice.  The Salmon Belly Sashimi was good, with a fresh and fatty taste, but at $6.30 for only 3 thinly sliced pieces, you might want to consider ordering more than one plate.  In conclusion, this restaurant is recommended for quick sushi bites, especially considering the delicious Sushi & Soba lunch set at a reasonable price. However, if you're specifically seeking larger portions of Salmon Belly Sashimi, you might find better options elsewhere."
Genki Sushi,"Service is good - staff were friendly and accommodating. However, quality of sashimi is questionable; we had salmon belly but it was cut too thin, and did not taste fresh. Aside from that, all food items were good."
Genki Sushi,"Very bad service. There is an older Chinese speaking lady who seems to be in charge that is more concerned with where you sit than anything else such as cleanliness of tables. Tried to chang from bar to table when we became 3 pax but the lady said its reserved for 4 pax only. It was just after 3pm on a Monday weekday afternoon, all the tables were empty. Don't think there will be a rush on tables during the time we are dining there. Tried to ask another younger staff for help, she looked towards the older lady so we assume she must be in charge. Decided to walk out after that as the staff  continued to ignore us. This is the 2nd time we've encountered this rude older Chinese speaking lady. Stay away and patronise their other outlet at I12 Katong. Never had any issues there. Glad that there is a Donki at PLQ so I still got my salmon aburi mentaimayo fix."
Genki Sushi,Do they have the best sushi? No. Do they have the best ordering system? Also no. But are the aunties doing their best? Probably yes. It’s Genki sushi. Just go when they are not too crowded and much of the problems can be avoided. Otherwise just gotta accept the shortcomings of the system cos there is nothing the staff there can really do.
Genki Sushi,Packed and not easy to get a seat as usual at genki. Still a happy place for kids. Umpteen visits to this branch near my place.  Will recommend.service is quite ok.
Genki Sushi,I feel better then Sake sushi thro. My own preference bah. Didn’t know beef sushi also taste good too. Somehow their seasonal ginger is rather thinner slice and taste very well balanced. Sweet Sour and not hot. :thumbs_up_light_skin_tone::thumbs_up_light_skin_tone:
Genki Sushi,"Been my go-to place for Japanese food for around 2 years now. Food was better last time but it's still good till today. You order your food through the QR code that they gave and they will come through a belt system. Time for the food to arrive is pretty fast so you don't really have to wait.  If you don't mind waiting during peak hours, I say it's a decent restaurant to have your meals here.  As for the price side, it's affordable but not cheap.  Once again, would come back again :red_heart:"
Genki Sushi,"Def one of my fav go to japanese restaurant for fresh sashimi. The best thing is, the price is reasonable as well! maybe i don’t have exp taste bud but i feel this is really comparable to those exp restaurants out there (not sponsored ok).  food is prompt, service was great too. staff will follow up when the order is not served after a period of time.  tried their new item - truffle wagyu sushi @ $5.90, damn good!  currently they are having a monthly promo for members on the first wednesday of every month, 20% off total bill. such a great deal so don’t missed it! i think they have reduce the requirement to become a member, do check it out w them.  members also get to use the app to take queue number and track the number before u slowly make ur way to the restaurant. i always try to visit this outlet during wkday lunch as the dinner crowd after 645pm is quite insane alr so do take a number earlier to avoid a 1-2h wait. they also have dine in duration limit at night too."
Genki Sushi,"Waited for about 45 mins on a weekend 2pm. Thought there would not be much of a queue since it's slightly past lunch hour but I guess not.  Food wise, it's okay. The service crew is pleasant to work with as well. Food is well priced, but portions are a tad smaller than other sushi places."
Genki Sushi,"It was a very nice place to go to for food and love the speed that food was served. Love the white peach ice cream. The taste is amazing... and also my fav fries!!! Clean but not much service from staff, although it's automated ordering and serving I feel staffs still need to smile and be more welcoming for the customers."
Genki Sushi,"Had a huge sumptuous feast at Genki Tampines Mall and it was one of my enjoyable moments with Japanese food.  The service from the staff was very good and the food was also very fresh. When I sought clarification over the contents of some of the newly created dishes, the managers made quite an effort to address my questions.  Which also explains why the restaurant is very packed with a queue during lunch hours.  Hope that they can keep it up!  Highly recommended to visit this branch again."
Genki Sushi,I am a loyal customer of Genki Sushi but today’s experience is disappointing.  Posting this so that can remind others to be careful of undercooked food. (This is chicken burger sushi). Manger was nice to apologize and replace a new plate for me but I declined the offer.  Undercooked chicken is unsafe to be eaten. Hope Genki Sushi will look into this matter and be more careful of the food preparation.
Genki Sushi,"Don't get me wrong, I have been a fan of genki for years. However, in my recent visit when I accidentally included an order to cart and check it out. I realised that I ordered an additional salmon don which I didn't need. I immediately asked the waiter to cancel the additional salmon don in which the waiter replied, ""oh orders cannot be cancelled"", which explains the rating to reflect my disappointment in their inflexible system."
Genki Sushi,The standard here is :thumbs_down:. Service was bad and everybody's face was scowling. food was not prepared properly. Long wait to enter even though I went at non peak timing and the restaurant wasn't even close to full. Go to other outlets better
Genki Sushi,I had a good experience during my visit on a weekday lunch time. Minimal queue and food was served promptly. Food was served piping hot and the salmon was fresh and thick. Recommended for a quick fix of your japanese craving
Genki Sushi,"Ordering was easy, although it seems my order was missed out. Waited 15 mins and eventually it came. Not sure why the plates, including the ones with sashimi served on them were extremely oily. Service was good though, no complains about that."
Genki Sushi,"The food qualities are the worse ever! Look at the whole food presentation and overall food hygiene! Horrible! When we came in at 8.30pm, the staff told us the last order is 9pm. Our food has been delayed and it was like a rush for the kitchen to serve out the food. Chawamushi came out watery and uncooked, took them another 15mins to re-do. Our first order is at 8.39pm, we waited for more than 20 mins for our food, when we asked the staff to help us check our order, her reply was “you know you have to wait for the food” and just walked away like that. So this is the right servicing attitude towards customers. Well done! Anyways I am super angry and disappointed with today’s experience in Genki Sushi! I will never spend a single cent in this restaurant ever again!"
Genki Sushi,"Service and food standards are incredibly subpar at this Genki joint.  Staff kept 3 tables and at least 6 counter seats open for no reason despite there being a queue at peak hr dinnertime, making the wait for seats longer than it should have been. Food served was made without care (pictured is the rice portion of the tamago I ordered) with all the sushi rice falling apart, chawanmushi had no taste and was served w a greasy spoon, portions generally looked a lot smaller than what Genki serves at other outlets. Softshell crab was over fried and had no taste. Staff expected me to pass my stack of plates over my friend's face instead of coming over to my side to collect it, and didn't even ask, just stood there waiting. We were seated at the counter and there was space beside me to pick up the plates.  Generally the outlet was not very busy since almost half of it was kept empty and the staff were definitely not in a situation where poorer service would be understandable. I love Genki esp. the tampines outlet but I won't be coming back here."
Genki Sushi,"Waited 45 mins for this fries, understand that they r short staffed and thus took way longer however server was not only unapologetic about it, refused to give us an estimate time of how long it would take and kept trying to chase us away. Other server Nicole was really nice and understanding thou and really tried to help us. The only redeeming quality of this outlet."
Genki Sushi,The place is poorly ventilated and stuffy. The manager wasn’t keen to help.  The salmon belly doesn’t taste good as before. Think they are using cheaper ingredient. Overall service is below par.
Genki Sushi,"The snow-crab croquette is very good and only for around $2.60-$2.80.  Crispy on the outside, and silky soft & cream on the inside, with a touch of butter taste.  Overall very good experience & easy to order. Can simply scan the QR code & order on your phone. The food will arrive by train similar to all their outlets."
Genki Sushi,"Good variety of platters to choose from for a party. Good mix of cooked and raw sushi. Really like the Mentaiko Salmon, Butter Prawn and Unagi. Will reorder again."
Genki Sushi,"oh I LOVE IT :fire::fire::fire: - very clean - staff is accommodating and friendly - food is AMAZING, i HIGHLY recommend the mini salmon avo mentai don (but sometimes they give very little avocado :broken_heart:) but the cold zaru soba is quite salty the icecream is just ok i guess it's not bad - food is served quickly (even if it's peak hour it still arrives fresh and tastes great) overall, 10/10 :fire::fire::fire: #seungminapproved"
Genki Sushi,"This is a popular outlet always with queue during lunch and dinner. It is advisable to spare 20-30 min for waiting. I like the queue system that Genki sushi provides. Pantrons could go for a leaiure walk and receive text message reminder when the queue number has 3 group ahead and once the number is called. Overall, the food ordering also very handy with QR scan. Waiting time is short after order submission."
Genki Sushi,"Apart from long Q (we were lucky, can get last minutes entry, 40 mins before closure), overall good dining experience. Super nice Sushi and Don, especially the Pork Don, as well as order was taken online with pretty fast turnaround time. The green tea is also nice and can be ""refilled"" few times by topping up hot water."
Genki Sushi,"The queue did not move at all. Spotted cleared tables and empty tables, not cleaned for more than 10-20 mins. Estimated time is way under estimated as they prioritise seating 3 or more pax diners while diners with 1 - 2 pax will face longer waiting times.  Empty seats galore, but no movement at all in queue number. Understand long waiting times for packed restaurants, but during my 40 min wait, there were many empty tables waiting to be filled, but none of the staff seemed interested in seating the smaller groups. So only 1 set of diners with 2 pax were seated.  I gave up and dined at a nearby Sushi Tei where service was prompt, food quality was good. Honestly, not that much more expensive (maybe $10 extra per pax vs Genki) and we were done eating in less than an hour.  Honestly, no one is exaggerating in the reviews when they say that this outlet has a queue management issue.  I have dined at other outlets and never experienced a situation where after queueing 40 mins only 1 number in the queue moved."
Genki Sushi,"One of the worst dining experience I had from a restaurant and surprisingly it is a japanese cuisine.  The google reviews are true to their words. The service is so slow and the food comes too infrequently (>15-30mins for a dish?!)  Don’t even bother to dine here (unless you do not mind waiting for 1 hour and more) as you can really spend long hours here by eating a few dishes served to you.  The quality of the sushi and salmon do not seem fresh for my liking too.. considering it is from a restaurant standard…  I found it strange that the staff asked if they can take away the ginger, soysauce from your assigned table(?)  What a bad dining experience and will never patron this outlet ever."
Genki Sushi,"Rarely very upset about a service crew!  Would have given a 0 star for this review, Crew (MAGGIE) at Vivo City!  Patronised Vivo City outlet during non-peak period on 02 June 23, there was a queue and waited for an hour which was acceptable for Genki. When we were brought in to our seats, we ordered quite a bit of food that occupied the table and came along multiple times of this service crew named (Maggie) with a long black face throughout her duties.  She was very unprofessional with her customer service and duties. Whichever we had consumed, we stacked the plates/bowls and put it aside for them to clear anytime, so that our meals will not be interrupted, when Maggie came, instead collecting the dirty plates/bowl, she took the fresh chawanmushi with her dirty hands (with sauce as you can see from the picture) away and we stopped her, she gave a sickening looks and pushed it back to us. (We told ourselves, maybe she was having a bad day, let it rest).  What triggered us subsequently were, she kept coming to replenish plates and chopsticks multiple times without drying them, while I was talking to my friend, she intercepted from the middle a few times, what happens if she hits our faces or she could be holding something hot, when either of us stand to leave for something else? She has no sense of awareness, she threw the plates and chopsticks loudly as if the world owe her!  The fact was all the seats away from us have sufficient plates and chopsticks for other diners to use, what is the rush and not wiping them with water dripping on my arm, watch, my friend’s arm/pants and tables? She did not apologise at all, I wonder why Genki Sushi still hire someone when she is clearly unfit to be in service line. If seats are not occupied, she can do her duty to replenish but not the other way round, it was not peak-hours and should have spoken to the diners properly.  Would not patronise this outlet anymore, given the fact the food is quite pricey not that as consumers, we can’t afford but the service and atmosphere is 0/10, very inconsistent and what most of them are doing especially this lady mentioned above, do things as if she is a robot. She would come to a few tables while other diners are dining, she did the same thing and diners said she clearly do not understand what is respect and basic courtesy!  Utensils in F&B should be wiped dry before presenting back to the holding area, this is the basic SOP but this outlet does not practice it.  During payment, she was pulling a long black face too, she did not even ask if we are members and you’ve to tell her and the mode of your payment. Look at the photo, she doesn’t even look, smile, maintain eye-contact and thank the rest of the diners, including us.  Crew with such working attitude, should be given a stern warning or even asked to leave as this would affect the company’s reputable because of such rotten apples around!"
Genki Sushi,"This branch has gotta be the WORST GENKI BRANCH EVER! Kitchen service is all jumbled up sending wrong orders to us, sashimi were entirely NOT FRESH, their service staff don't even know what is the name of that dish when we tried to identify the dish that we received, and even removed our food without saying anything in order to get it identified.. food presentation was also very poor, like the kitchen team is entirely not interested in working.. should have checked Google review score before coming!"
Genki Sushi,"Took my 1 year old here for lunch on a weekday, just before peak hours. I was seated immediately because it wasn’t crowded yet. Service was standard and food quality is good for the price we paid. Waitresses always promptly took empty plates away.  Quality is consistent with other Genki Sushi outlets I’ve been to. The Rainbow Sushi set for kids is a good portion in my opinion, too much for my 1yo but should be ok for toddlers."
Genki Sushi,Tried the lunch set and didn't really find it value for money as there was only small portion of meat and too much rice. I think the sushi is a much better value for money instead. The train was a novelty and there was written instructions to pick the food from the train. Overall it's interesting experience to try once in Singapore.
Genki Sushi,"Good use of technology to deliver food. Note that it's almost silent. So look out for the food when they arrive. Good range of sushi, dons etc. Can get various choices to try. Their mini-don is great too. Enjoy"
Genki Sushi,"Food was average, liked the mentaiko sauce, however salmon wasn’t really fresh. Was pretty expensive and for this price, I would expect better quality"
Genki Sushi,"Nice tasty sushi :sushi:,  overall :face_savoring_food: :OK_hand:.  Maybe I should come earlier as they rushed to pack up and go home , so feel pressure to eat. Not like the old days , when they wait till all guest left ..:grinning_face:"
Genki Sushi,"Went for lunch on a Saturday at the hillion outlet. Was eating halfway and a cockroach nymph crawled out onto our table. They offered to switch our table and said they will inform their manager. (Not sure if they would do it) The floor below our table was dirty, littered with chopstick, wasabi packets, tissue paper and sushi rice. Had to infrom the staff who then proceeded to sweep it up. The hygiene at this outlet is extremely poor."
Sushiro,"There’s a long queue during peak hour, but you can scan a QR code to queue and come back when it’s nearing your turn soon.  There’s also a long stretch of chairs for you to sit and wait for your turn.  Food was fresh and tasty! You can self service and have unlimited refills for cold plain water."
Sushiro,Place is busy each time I've gone for lunch and dinner...   Everything was fresh and worth the wait.    Really do suggest the big prawn sushi; super good.  Speed of service and getting food off conveyor belt offsets the wait.     Also good tablet based ordering system minimizes the need to talk with the staff.  So good this is right by the theater.     Pop in for a meal before or after the movie.
Sushiro,"Came here with an advanced reservation made 2 weeks prior. Our reservation was for 4 for 1215pm. There wasn't many people at this timing, even prefect for individual eaters. More people came at 1pm. Food selection seem to also be slightly different than the wwp outlet which was interesting. Food standard also taste equally fresh. So far, Sushiro hasn't disappoint. Keep it up :thumbs_up::thumbs_up:"
Sushiro,"Great sushi as always - in terms of variety, taste, and cost. Always a joy to come in to try the seasonal offerings. Service at Scott's outlet is pretty great! Helpful, flexible and forthcoming. I'd come back again but it's usually always packed! Come/book early to avoid the mealtime rush."
Sushiro,One of the best options for your sushi fixes! The food was fresh and savory and we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. Queues are extremely long especially during peak hours but they have a somewhat good management of the queue. We waited about an hour but walked around Shaw while waiting. Will be back!
Sushiro,"Came here with my friends, we were pretty excited that a Japanese chain had opened it's doors in Singapore.  I personally was a little disappointed, we ordered the tuna belly sushi. Although they were quite generous with the portion and the price was of great value, the fish was still frozen. I felt so insulted for the fish, such a great cut of fish to be served that way.  However, what sold me was the premium unagi sushi. Really good.  Generally - it's an average experience for me."
Sushiro,Service was really friendly and good. I love that it was mostly self-service as well though. Food was good and served pretty quickly. I’ll definitely return if I’m in the area and craving sushi.
Sushiro,Wanted to try this chain of sushi restaurant and skipped the nearby branch as this one has higher rating. We were pleasantly surprised. Highly satisfied.
Sushiro,Here for the salmon - better than genki & sushi express. Scallop was slightly fishy for me. Don't like their broiled items as much. Queues are long even on a Wednesday.
Sushiro,Sushiro is always the best place I go to satisfy my sushi craving. Decent quality at reasonable prices. Love the Ebi mentai in particular as the prawn is always plump and juicy!
Sushiro,"Nice place. Food served very fast. Everything is fresh as it is made to order, not like those rotatory sushi shops where the food is made hours ago. Price is very reasonable. Located just at the entrance of Suntec shopping mall. Also have nice takeaway sets."
Sushiro,"The atmosphere is rated five stars for it's bright, clean and spacious layout. Service by the staff is good and prompt. Patient staff directing and attending at the shortest time. Food arrive very fast when ordered on the conveyor. Sushi is average though with the cuts quite thin. Four stars for a first time visit. Food quality can be improved."
Sushiro,My absolute favourite sushi chain in Singapore as I always frequent here the sushi is always super fresh! Though sometimes the queue is rather long but it’s worth it but at non lunch or dinner hours there may or may not have a queue for sushi wise I definitely would recommend the basil cheese salmon can never get enough of it! If you do want to treat yourself the otoro is really good as well desserts wise there’s always plenty to choose from normally I would recommend the seasonal stuff! They don’t disappoint! There’s a self service water dispenser if you do need a cup of water also staff is always really friendly and attentive. Would recommend! There’s a point system also to redeem certain items after a point!
Sushiro,"Sushiro has always delivered decent quality food at reasonable prices! It’s definitely my favourite chain for this level of pricing. Tried a variety of sushi today. Haven’t been back in a while now. Most of the sushi was good. Really enjoyed the Uni and crab ones, and especially loved the dry noodles and clam soup! Will definitely be back for reasonably priced Japanese food! Oishii Desu!"
Sushiro,"The queues are really long during meal times. Service has improved a little since my last visit. If you do not prebook / reserve, be prepared to wait.  The food is good value for money. Inexpensive Japanese food for all. Note that they only allow 1 hour dining."
Sushiro,Sushi was not bad though many items could not be found in the electronic menu. No mentaiko fries. Think probably sold out as it was a Saturday. Got our seat within 5 mins which was good. Typical sushi place.
Sushiro,"First time visiting this outlet. Not much people on a Sunday. Usually for other outlet, we need to wait for 15 to 30 min with reservation. Food is better than other outlet. Only down side is the water machine can only dispense room temperature water."
Sushiro,The initial service wasn't very good. The person simply left the cup with a big thud on the table and we were shocked like what happen. Food is so so for the price. Would have expected more variety and better quality for the price.
Sushiro,"Visited around 1130am on a Fri and was rather pleased. Typically, they have seasonal menu too. Would recommend their cold chawanmushi if you’re feeling adventurous. Salmon maki, mentaiko fries and fried octopus were good too. Kids-friendly and causal dining food at reasonable price. Definitely will revisit again."
Sushiro,"Even when this outlet was at its worst (stuffy, aircon not on) their cooked food was done as well as what sushiro standards are to be. Crispy juicy chicken. This time around chicken was fried so long till the color of the skin came out real really dark with many CHARRED spots. Needless to say the meat was mostly dry and is not worth the price.  I have been a regular since pre covid days since I stay around the area. But if your cooks are so incompetent that they cannot even fry chicken. I think I might even consider low rated genki at katong outlet/sakae sushi East Coast rd to be a better choice.  Sushiro - to me, have always been slightly pricier food yet better quality food. Presently if someone says that to me, I consider it as fake news."
Sushiro,"A great place for conveyor belt sushi.  Wide selection of sushi options.  Fast delivery response time.  I like all their different salmon options, as well aa their grilled pork and beef sushi.  Also a favourite as side snacks are their cuttlefish and prawn tempura.  Their Ramen options are also value for money.  All in all, a great sushi place to bring your kids and family."
Sushiro,"The food is great, service is good and they will disinfect the tables before the next customer uses the space. The wet tissue and water is FOC. This is a good place for people who also enjoy eating alone. U don't really feel awkward when eating alone as there are many others who does it too."
Sushiro,"Nice conveyer belt sushi experience. Also, quite economical if you are having sushi cravings.  My only complaint is the the rice doesn’t hold up very well and disintegrated quite easily.  Some of the stars of the evening were shrimp topped with spicy mayo, mentai salmon and the cheesecake."
Sushiro,one of my favourite go-to places for good sushi 
Sushiro,"Honestly the food is mostly good, but the service was among the worst for a Japanese chain. Overall, we did enjoy the following: :crab:Crab Croquettes :dragon:Dragon Roll :fish:Salmon w basil cheese :passenger_ship:Various Gunkan  It’s quite weird that upon taking a digital queue number, there is a need to “check-in” (& it’s not stated too) the staff will casually pass your number without asking too. Had to recitfy twice before we got our tables."
Sushiro,"The conveyer belt has some issue so the opp plate flew down in front of me haha,So beware..food is good and price is affordable. Sashimi is fresh too. Serving portion is just nice. But the cashier is quite rude,not sure if it is the same person as receipt state Larry.  Wearing mask with specs, told the cashier I'll be using fave voucher, the cashier tot is fraser. Dun sound local. Expect cust to use automated, when i say im using fave, the face turn black..When asked where to press the fave voucher, the person just replied I dunno. Very unsincere attitude. Prefer those ladies who serve at table. More polite and friendly."
Sushiro,"First time eating in sushiro(SG). Overall dining experience was just ok. For service-wise, my partner and I were asked how we wanted to sit, side by side which was counter or face to face which was table. We chose side by side and we were brought to our seats. Staff explained to us to order from the tablet provided and wasabi to taken from the conveyor belt. All these which we already knew thanks to sharing from friends. Other than that, there wasn't any other forms of service provided to justify the service charge. Just saying....  For food-wise, there was nothing bad about the food. Food is fresh, fried food are cooked upon order and ramens were served piping hot. One downside is the sushi rice which kept breaking up. I think for sushiro's standard this is not acceptable.  Price-wise is definitely slightly higher compared to similar establishments.  There were cups and water dispenser for self-service. Same goes for payment on a self-service kiosk.  3 stars because of the taste of food."
Sushiro,"Brought my wife and my 2 boys to the waterway point outlet on a sat for dinner. I expected a long wait before we get our seats. True enough, we waited about an hour to get in. The quality of the food are ok but their ramen portion is so pathetic and small. They seems to have some issue with their water supply that day. No access to their soft drink station. Not a very good experience, and I very naturally forgotten to take photos of our food. Just wanted to quickly finish my meal and get out of that place. Certainly need to to buck up and improve."
Sushiro,Lucky i didnt need to queue  Pros: eggplant is so good! Salmon is good!  Cons: the meat is seriously tough. The potato taste like got giner inside.
Sushiro,"Among all the Japanese restaurant that incorporate a sushi conveyor belt, sushiro is my favourite as it offer a huge variety of fishes as sashimi and has many other cooked stuff to choose from allowing an inclusive family experience for all!"
Sushiro,"Located at level 5 of Causeway point, it is a pretty big outlet with seats that can seat up to a grp size of 4. Conveyor belt sushi style as well as tablet ordering available. Recommend to get their hot/ fried dishes as they are fresh. Food came quite fast too!  Lunch for 5 came up to $130++. Quite pricey as compared to other chains but nothing to complain about as seafood seems fresh too. Service is great, the waiters are friendly and happy to help. Stack up your plates according to colour to help them calculate the total cost, before they come around to send to your bill."
Sushiro,"It's Sushiro and with it comes a certain expectations for freshness and seasonal offerings that is in sync with Japan. That said, I think on my this visit, while it wasn't unpleasant in anyway.. the offering seems to be more pedestrian and hardly exciting."
Sushiro,"I have not eaten Sushiro for a long time. but it was a pleasure eating it again.  I was a little dissapointed with the sea urcin menu, it tasted so bad. not fresh at all.  But other than that, it was really good.  Love the tuna karaage. recommended it."
Sushiro,"Came here to dine on my own and ordered 1 tonkotsu kaza ramen (lunch special), 1 chawamushi, and 3 $2.30 sushi. Food is good and the staff is nice."
Sushiro,"𝙏𝙪𝙣𝙖 (𝙡𝙚𝙨𝙨 𝙛𝙖𝙩𝙩𝙮) : My fav out of all, melt-in-the-mouth with a buttery taste! [9/10] 𝙏𝙪𝙣𝙖 𝙬𝙞𝙩𝙝 𝙜𝙧𝙚𝙚𝙣 𝙤𝙣𝙞𝙤𝙣 : I liked how the spring onions cut the richness of the tender minced tuna.

Sushiro,"I like the sushi :sushi: their salmon sushi was good and fresh. I took the kid's set since my kids would be eating them but should not put raw one for kids. Cucumber maki was ok. Few pieces of cucmber maki were in the set.  Ordering a bit uncommon, taking the sushi at one side and payment at the other side. Didn't see any seat to dine-in, it seems only for take away."
Sushiro,Super new restaurant! Service is great as usual food was fresh and staff were rather attentive there are some promotions as of now 31/07/23 as it’s a new stall. The prawn with avocado was great and basil cheese salmon and chawamushi was good with a nice amount of ingredients inside. Overall would recommend there’s a self service water and condiments or you can order though the iPad provided on the table.
Sushiro,"First visit to sushiro wisma. We were at the ticket counter when our number was called. However due to the dinner crowd, and probably new staffing at new outlet, the staff didn't manage to scan our number in time and the queue system skipped our turn. The staff had to give us a new number and thankfully it wasn't a long wait before we were seated... Sashimi was definitely fresh but the sushi platter seemed to have shrank in size (thinner slices) as compared to other branches."
Sushiro,Good experience. A bigger outlet compared with others. Use the app to reserve the table before going there can get a table faster.
Sushiro,I went there with my friends and we enjoyed the experience very much. Chairs and tables are spanking new and service was very good. Great location as well. Price is not that expensive and makes a great place to dine for families and solo diners.   Two thumbs up to this place.
Sushiro,I am happy to see one more Japanese food place in Jewel as there are simply not enough Japanese food around us :-)  This outlet is quite new so everything looks just nice & clean!  We arrived around noon time on a Sunday afternoon & were lucky to get a table within minutes :grinning_face_with_sweat:  Food were served via the conveyor belt promptly but some food was not placed properly so presentation wise I hand to say some are way below standard.
Sushiro,No frills dining with acceptable sushi for the price that you pay. Uni dry ramen was a bit overwhelming. Would recommend the salmon with mentai cheese / basil cheese. Giant scallop was also good too. Great that water is complimentary too.
Sushiro,Nice dining experience here. Sushi selection is very unique compared to other sushi place. The miso soup came with clams wow. Service is fast. I like the double storey belt where the lower one is for the usual sushi go round and the upper one is for your own table order. Will be back! :face_savoring_food: :sushi:
Sushiro,Great experience! Sushi tastes amazing fresh and every plate made to order :0
Sushiro,Weekday lunches used to be quite crowded but nowadays you can walk it and the restaurant is usually not more than 60% full. Weekends are still very crowded. Quality is the same as other outlets and always consistent. Staff are attentive enough and they don’t enforce the 1 hour dining limit if the restaurant is not full.
Sushiro,"First time in a sushi place with a conveyor belt, was pretty cool. The sushi was pretty good for the low prices, also liked the unlimited drinks at 3 dollars. Definitely would visit again."
Sushiro,"Out of the 5 branches I visited this month, this is definitely the least consistent in service despite coning at non peak - 4pm. My seat was mistakenly given to another walk in group as the staff didn't check queue ticket.  I was not given a wet tissue when seated. There were no spoons or sauce plate at my table. Upon requesting the staff gave me a stack and asked me to refill it at my table. The spoon I took was not clean either. There were also random empty lids on the belt which was mostly empty compared to other outlets. They were never cleared throughout the length of my visit. There was barely any aburi on the aburi and serving of rice and topping in the uni wrap was not ideal. Lastly, pressed the call staff button to end meal but no one showed up for 10 mins, had to manually call staff.  Would probably avoid this outlet in future."
Sushiro,"standard of sushi here is the same when compared with other outlets I’ve tried. Salmon, Big red shrimp and scallop are always so good. Service here is exceptional though, the staff, Yan Hua is very polite!"
Sushiro,"Last came here about 1.5 years ago, around dinner time. Sushiro has always been good and consistent throughout their outlets so you can expect the same quality here. Don't like the 1hr dining time limit though but I understand why it is implemented."
Sushiro,"Sushiro hired a gem! Yan Hua was extremely courteous during my every visit, provided dedicated customer service and its been a real long time since I experience such wonderful service attitude!  My visit today was late (9+pm on a Tuesday), any service staff would have been tired at this point but yet she still greeted each customer passionately and gave seasonal recommendations very eloquently. Thank you for the amazing hospitality!  Food is great of course! Looking forward to my next visit."
Rappu Handroll Bar,"Overall decent experience but felt something is missing like pebbles in your shoes.  Nice ambience, music selection can be better. Filling amount and decent food quality, just that the sauce can be lighter on the touch because the hand rolls all tasted too salty for me without drink pairing. My favorite is the salmon and tuna. Service is good and basic."
Rappu Handroll Bar,"Our party of two enjoyed the elevated way of eating sushi, in this trendy eater. We saw each sushi handrolled in front of us, with interesting and delicious combinations of fillings using fresh ingredients. Opting for the sake pairings, we tasted different sakes too and how the sake compliments the sushi. A great venue for couples where you can easily have a conversation without the ambience music getting in the way. Just one point for the restaurant to note, please keep the flambe process away from your patrons."
Rappu Handroll Bar,"I walked in without a reservation but the staff were very accommodating and friendly. love the vibes - would give 10 stars if I could! the rolls were really great. will come back for the uni, ikura and scallops!"
Rappu Handroll Bar,"first things first - absolutely love the vibe & ambience! had a seat at the counter where the staff prepares both the drinks/food in front if you so quite an immersive experience as well.  staff are friendly & knowledgable with recommendations, handrolls are sooooo good! seafood is fresh (the uni is melt in your mouth) and the rolls literally are amazing (think warm rice and hot crispy nori).  most people get the set with the sake pairings too!  + points for the playlists :heart_hands_light_skin_tone:"
Rappu Handroll Bar,"Hip yet traditional in both food & drinks line-up espy., sake pairing - a must! Crispy seaweed hand rolls are huge draw. Happy Mother’s Day 2023 :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes:"
Standing Sushi Bar,"really enjoyed this small dinner :sparkling_heart: beers, salmon on promo by 5 pieces for $3.90, hot seafood soup in a teapot, finished off with cold soba. the quality is very mid, BUT I think altogether- it’s a worth it meal."
Standing Sushi Bar,"Love it! Superb sushi quality for the price and good service! They have great deals and there wasn't any unexpected T&Cs/ hidden charges. They have super affordable drinks menu too. Thanks SS Bar, I will be back with my friends for a proper dinner and drink."
Standing Sushi Bar,"Food was delicious, love the design of the place and great services too!! Highly recommended to check it out!!  There’s also a daily promotion going on, so head to their website to check!!"
Standing Sushi Bar,"Beautiful environment, general service, food is delicious, here to recommend a few: Under the sea. Shrimp King. Yuzu roll and tea rice  The serving time is generally 15 minutes, the taste is good, recommended"
Standing Sushi Bar,"The rockstar roll and wagyu beef superstar is our top fav! A huge must try. Spicy salmon belly was really good too with nice fatty salmon (quite a generous amount). Tuna tataki however tasted a little mediocre, and not as fresh as expected.  Went on a tuesday so we had their 50% off for some of the nigiri sushi. Loved the yellowtail too!"
Standing Sushi Bar,"1st time trying here. A bit disappointed with the size of salmon sashimi although it’s cheap price ($3.9 for 5pcs) on Monday&Thursday. It’s just half of the usual size for sashimi if you go anywhere else. Good thing is thick cut, good flavor, fresh. Salmon belly needs to be separately ordered on regular price. Unagi sushi roll is tasty. The rice is flavorful. But it could be a bit more complicated than just putting unagi on top of the rice. Service is good. Can sit down at the table not really the “standing”style like the name. Anyways very unlikely to go back again."
Standing Sushi Bar,-1 star: Vegetarians have little dining options. Little/No room for customisation for existing menu options. Also a pretty ordinary (but functional) Japanese restaurant in my opinion.  Visited during weekday lunch hour period as it was 1 of the few restaurants where there were no queues.  Menu is a digital one where you scan the QR code plastered on the table. Orders are still taken via the service staff.  Warm water had lemon pre-soaked in it. Drinks were promptly given to us.  Staff was kind enough to check for me (with the chef) regarding my order customisation. What I asked for was to remove the sauce from the chicken terayaki set or the ala carte oyako don. The chef said no.  Vegetarians only have maki sushi to choose from (or soba). There’s a don for vegetarians but somehow it’s only available at the other outlet (as stated on the menu).
Standing Sushi Bar,"Very nice and authentic Japanese food. We had sushi, sashimi, grilled fish, wagyu beef and braised pork belly donburi. All tasted fantastic. Will definitely visit again"
Standing Sushi Bar,"Came for the salmon sashimi and sake weekday promo. Sashimi was fresh, housepour sake was alright. Overall, great post-work dinner spot because it wasn’t noisy"
Standing Sushi Bar,"What a difference in standards between 2 separate outlets under the same name.. Ordered their wagyu don, hirami sashimi as well as hundred year maki as well as another 1 or 2 dishes that i cant remember,but was not worth mentioning anyways. Wagyu don was bland,bland bland,with no taste nor sauce for the rice,which was way too al-dente for my liking. Wagyu slices were so hard and chewy until i had to just spit out some pieces,it was awful indeed. Hirami sushi was tasteless as well,also rather chewy. It didnt have the sweetness normally associated with fresh flounder. As for the hundred year maki,the sushi rice grains were also hard and bland,and the maki had no century egg taste nor pi-tan smell to it whatsoever. We left at least half the plate untouched in the end. I honestly dunno why the food standards here differ so so greatly from the one at Odeon towers,which we just ate at 1 week ago.. Service felt very very rushed also from a few of their wait staff who were rushing me to take the order. Spacing between tables felt alot like a production factory line as weĺl,packed as many as one can into that space. All in,we totally didnt enjoy ourselves one bit here and couldnt wait to pay up and leave. My Rating: 2/10"
Uminami Sushi Bowl,"Decent rice bowls at affordable prices. Sashimi may not be the freshest but at this price point, if your stomach can take it, then go for it! Most of it is self service from the food ordering to getting your own water, soya sauce and toppings if needed."
Uminami Sushi Bowl,"Cheapest bowls of chirashi I have ever eaten. But that aside. The quantity and price ratio I would say its quite alright. $10 for my Barachirashi, but the quantity of fish is enough to barely cover the rice. Rice is rather grainy than sticky and still has warmth. 1st time seeing raw shrimp in barashirashi bowl. I rate: 4/5 :glowing_star:  Onsen Tamago egg has a truffle smell in it. I wonder why they add truffle oil to my onsen egg hahaha I rate: 4/5 :glowing_star:  Aburi scallops was alright. Nothing special. 8 pieces of scallops with mayo, tobiko and some scorching. I rate: 3/5 :glowing_star:  Water is complimentary. Would come here again for sure if I'm looking for budget Japanese food in the Holand V area :)"
Uminami Sushi Bowl,"Overall, Umi Nami offers reasonably priced and decent dons with generous amounts of ingredients in the Holland Village area. There's nothing too outstanding about the taste of the dons but the sashimi was fresh and succulent! I would definitely eat here as an option again if I have cravings and I'm in the area. One comment on the outside seating tables is that there's gaps so placing the cups of drinks and even the little sauce dish might be abit unsteady so do becareful.  Staff were pretty chill and friendly contrary to the reviews I've read and one of the staff did check in on us occasionally. Ordering and payment was self service via QR code and the place was moderately crowded on a Friday lunch (1pm-ish) so we were able to get seats immediately."
Uminami Sushi Bowl,salmon was nice and fresh but feel that the rice is too clumpy. price is slightly above avg. small shot glass of sake costs $5. service definitely need some improvement… i was just shown to my seat and that’s it… i wonder if that’s the reason for no service charge…
Uminami Sushi Bowl,Affordable chirashi options and fresh sashimi available. The price is very affordable. Staff is very accomodating.
Sushi Airways,"The food never disappointed. I have been there 10 years ago. The food is always good. The thematic of the restaurant has always been a seller. The furnishing of the restaurant has remained the same as I have visited 10 years ago. Hence, the wear and tear is evident. Not an easy area to park. Overall, still love the great food."
Sushi Airways,"Sashimi is fresh; even the umi sushi is tasty to me, who usually finds it too intense. Plating looks very elegant. Oyster small is enough, medium is too big to be bite-size (especially for girls!) Quite ex though. Very interesting restaurant layout. Each table has own privacy."
Sushi Airways,"The food is fantastic, love the freshness of the food. Definitely worth a visit. And Thank you for serving us the free dessert."
Sushi Airways,This is a fun and enjoyable little restaurant that has a quirky theme that doesn’t feel too cheesy. The food is presented well and all the little touches keep the theme and experience enjoyable. The sashimi is on point and super fresh and the miso is delicate and better than most places I’ve tried. It is a little on the high side but kinda worth it for the fun vibes.
Sushi Airways,Had a wonderful lunch here.  The food and ambience is pretty great. The raw stuff are fresh is delightful.  Shop decor really brings up the surreal feeling of dining in a retro airways of times past.
Mitsuba,Too good. Wish I know this place earlier. Foie gras with gold leaf is something new. Sadly I dun like the toast. Asked if can get only the four gras..cannot. so throw the toast away? I'm trying hard not to waste. Waygu was top notch. Oysters also one of the highlights.
Mitsuba,One of my fav go-to Japanese buffet. Super awesome and fresh sashimi serve. The quality is good. Thick cut:thumbs_up_medium-light_skin_tone:. Usually full house as it is very worth it I feel. The service staffs are also very friendly. Keep offering refill for the beverages and will check in to make sure you enjoy your food. Sashimi is good. I like their grilled items and tamago too!
Mitsuba,"Went there on a Monday evening for normal buffet, using tablet to order, food came quite fast, except for the set sashimi, got a complimentary mentaiko scallop per pax. Service starts to become slow on 2nd order waiting time is still reasonable, one thing I didn't really like is when I asked the waitress if I have any balance order, as I want to order more and don't want to double order, she told me I did have 5 more, and when I asked her what items, she told me some dishes I didn't order, a moment later she told me my cart is empty...like whut? If not the whole experience is great, the must try are the Unagi, Hamachi sashimi , smoked duck, meltique beef and Gindara teriyaki..the rest are all right. Total damage about $120 for 2 pax"
Mitsuba,"Nice Japanese family restaurant with spaced out seating arrangement. We had their weekend Japanese buffet, and it offers decent sashmi, grilled, and fried selections. Service staff are attentive, and our family of 13 had a great time. Sushi and handrolls abit meh. Look out for promotions where you can get a good deal"
Mitsuba,"• service: not bad, attentive most of the time • food came at approx 10 mins • sashimi was fresh, It doesn’t smell and the cut was thicckk! Delicious 10/10 • unagi was so so • food was on the pricier side. All these costed $98 • would go back for the sashimi and the chirashi don! Overall, 9/10"
Senshi,Dinner buffet - Below average. The quality of ingredients and cooking could be improved. The sashimi could be fresher. The grilled shishamo was rather dry. The garlic fried rice didn’t have much taste of garlic. The eggplant in miso sauce was too sweet. The baked oyster with mentaiko cheese was better.
Senshi,"Food: 4/5 We got both the noodles and the nice. For noodles: broth was very very flavorful, love it. For the rice: a bit too much water, quite soggy. Fish: fresh and tender Service: 3/5 Maybe we met some interns server, so there were missing spoon or ginger when the foods were served and they needed to be reminded to send us the always go together condiments. Also, there was just 1 server can speak English, which is weird as well, considering the restaurant was operated inside an international hotel :relieved_face:"
Senshi,"Fresh sashimi but cutting needs improvements (fish bones not removed and two pieces not separated). Good variety of appetizer, sashimi, grill and hotpot. However taste is very average...don't feel like anything else for 2nd round except sashimi. Good thing is they haven't missed any of my orders... Ordering system is very manual , I think a lot of restaurants have already switched to QR ordering which is more efficient. Lastly there is only a open kitchen so if you take counter seat you can smell the grill/ frying which is not very pleasant. Service is okay you need to get your own drinks. They clean the plates and deliver the food quickly."
Senshi,"Edited to 1 star. Had lunch buffet, but I was incorrectly charged for dinner rate of $55++, and when I called the restaurant, they wanted me to travel back to the restaurant to settle the payment. (seriously?) Only when I refused to do so, they offered to  pay via paynow for $10, which is still wrong considering that there are service charges and VAT included.  Eventually, I had to instruct them on how to calculate the differences properly to get what they overcharged me back. :confused_face:  Overall, it was a good dining experience. Sashimi is fresh and up to the standard of a Japanese restaurant in a hotel. Cooked dishes are generally ok. Services are excellent with attentive staff."
Senshi,"Updated: 10 Mar 2023 :slightly_smiling_face: adding more pics from my latest lunch @ Senshi. Still great food, great service, great ambience! :thumbs_up:  Visited: 16 dec 2022 :round_pushpin:located at Dorsett Hotel, nearest Mrt station will be Outram Park. Opened at 6pm for dinner..  :grinning_face_with_big_eyes: Nice cozy indoor settings with spacious seatings.  :thumbs_up:Staff made efforts to help us on seating as my partner requested for a corner seat.  :face_savoring_food: We opt for buffet, wide range of selection from menu.  :fish: Sashimi served on ice, cuts were thick and fresh! Sushi items were great as well! :cut_of_meat: Grilled items were flavourful with char. Piping hot food & good chilled sashimi :face_savoring_food:. Good small portioning that allow us to try more items since its buffet style. Quality of food seriously:thumbs_up::thumbs_up::thumbs_up:.  :shortcake::ice_cream: Nice yummy cold dessert ~ Soft serve & passionfruit cake. A good sweet ending for our dinner.  :thumbs_up: The service staff were friendly and attentive. Very helpful and gave good explanations on queries. Male manager attentive to ensure orders were served. Empty dishes were cleared off timely.  :megaphone: Recommended! Nice ambience. Great food quality and service, worthy for the price!!"
Tatsuya,"It was a rainy day as we arrived. A woman wearing kimono picked me up from the car with umbrella. Excellent service. Food we had omakase as I was too lazy to think, just tell them our restrictions and they settle the rest. The drinks paring was interesting."
Tatsuya,"Date of visit : 3 Feb 2023 Time : 8.30 pm  Made a reservation for 2. It’s my birthday and my partner wanted to celebrate with me. Decided to try here and see.  The bar counter probably can seat about 10-12. Inside where we are seated, 3 tables seating 8, 4 and 2 configurations. A few more tables alfresco outside facing the Carpark.  First time here, so a bit cautious. Ordered the 5 type sashimi, tuna belly roll, day special roll (deep fried swordfish with aburi    salmon on top), pan fried beef and 2 white rice.  Everything given was a bit teeny weeny. A bit miserly for a restaurant. For the sashimi, only one of each given, and not too great. The rolls are good, but tiny. Beef is ok.  Rose flavored tea served FOC at the end.  Service is great. The waitress is knowledgeable.  But won’t return."
Tatsuya,My favourite place for aburi sushi. Have been coming here for years and it never fails to please. We always sit at the counter so we can see the chef prepare the meal. It was a lovely meal as usual. Paired with a delicious junmai diginjo. Thank you.
Tatsuya,"Always a pleasure dining here, they are very flexible when it comes to ordering things not on the menu and the size and otoro as usual was superb. It was worth spending over $1000 for 4 adults 1 child.  Wish the indoor room at the back was partitioned as we had 2 other tables very close to us, talking loudly, picking up phone calls, burping/belching loudly and kept asking the waitress loudly what we were having at our table  etc probably better to brave the heat and just sit outside for some peace and quiet. The waitresses are still very attentive even if you sit outside based on our past experiences.  Thank you Ronnie and team."
Tatsuya,Treated hubby to a birthday lunch. Had the aburi sushi set and mini lunch course set. Was amazed by the freshness of their sashimi and the intricate details of their food presentation. The service staff there were very attentive too. Abit on the pricey side but overall a great experience.
Keisuke Ramen,"+ The broth is rich and flavourful + Free flow of hard boiled eggs and bean sprout. + 5 Type of ramen; King, summer, autumn, winter and spring. + option to fine tune your selection type. + Good taste.  - can feel the creaminess after eating awhile and making me feel like stopping, eating."
Keisuke Ramen,"great flavors, reasonable price, free pickles bean sprouts and boiled eggs. highly recommended! no booking allowed though so you may have to wait in queue"
Keisuke Ramen,"Excellent ramen place located in busy Bugis. Had a wait time of about 10 minutes on a weekday evening. Service is quick and friendly.  We got a pretty large table for 2 people, very comfortable. The space is quite large and the interiors are pretty. Some of the wall art is insta-worthy.  The theme of the restaurant is based on the 4 seasons of Japan, and the dishes are testament to that.  Ordered Tonkotsu king ramen and Tonkotsu ramen Autumn.  I would say there wasn’t much difference in the broths, both had a very similar taste that was soothing to the throat. Quite mild.  The winner was the spring noodles, and the cha shu (soft and tender). The A/C is quite strong, so gulp down your ramen before it gets too cold.  The onsen eggs and ramen add a nice dimension, so choose the special ramens, which offer these."
Keisuke Ramen,"Thematic and flavorful customisable ramen. Delicious! Winter was a strong pork bone soup. Autumn was so unique with the minced pork/mushroom flavor. Enjoyed both very much. Flavoured egg is very good too.  Free flow hard boiled egg, bean sprout, mayo~ spent s$42 for 2 pax."
Keisuke Ramen,Affordable and authentic ramen. You are able to choose from 4 different flavours with different selections of toppings.  Winter is rather more standard and basic Tonkotsu soup. You would enjoy winter soup if you wanna try authentic Tonkotsu soup. Autumn was with mushroom topping and would recommend if you like something less challenging but little different flavour.  Both are non spicy and I would say autumn has more umami :mushroom:  You’ll like free flow eggs and bean sprouts while waiting for your ramen
Keisuke Ramen,"Went for a late lunch but there was still a que of over 10 people ahead of me. Even though there were empty counter seats but staff did not come out to ask if anyone in que was keen to take those seats. I managed to get the attention of the staff and got to skip the que as I was a single diner. Ordering was pretty easy, scan the QR code to access the online menu. You can pay via credit card or at the counter (cash/card/nets). Do note that if you select the latter, you'll have to proceed to the counter to settle payment first before the order is sent to kitchen. Free flow of warm/iced water (look for it under beverage section and add to order), hard boil eggs and bean sprouts. Wide range of sauces at the table as well including a bottle of kewpie mayo. While placing the order you get to customise the soup taste (level of saltiness), how much flavour oil is preferred, noodle texture, condiments to omit as well as additional toppings. I went for the spicy option ie. red tonkotsu ramen ($12.90) with the addition of seaweed ($1.00). Food was served under 15mins. Hearty flavourful broth with a hint of spiciness from the chili oil and light dusting of shichimi togarashi, but was still rather mild for me. Felt the broth wasn't as thick as what it used to be. Had to add extra chili powder and chili oil for more spicy kick. Noodle were done just nice with an acceptable portion of thinly sliced pork and woodear mushroom. They seem to be short handed as i noticed some tables were not cleared promptly even after it was vacated. Be prepared to wait during meal times. Outlet is accessible from the outside of Payar Lebar Square (near the pickup/dropoff point) and across from singpost center."
Keisuke Ramen,"It was alright. Broth was thinner than expected but was still acceptable. Can't really go too wrong with Keisuke and their free flow eggs and beansprouts. Service staff were great and very helpful. The gyozas here are a dollar each ( comes in 3, 6, 10) but I can't really judge them fairly since I requested to take away and hence I didn't eat them right out of the kitchen. Good price though. Oh one more thing, the water was actually free, which is great! So please be mindful of how many cups you take, ideally we don't want to waste water + service staff effort."
Keisuke Ramen,"Simple and decent ramen To go place for tasty tonkotsu ramen, always great with their free flow eggs, bean sprouts, sesame seeds, and they provide free ice water too which is a plus! The restaurant temperature however was really warm and we were perspiring while drinking the hot soup."
Keisuke Ramen,Nice atmosphere and great service. Love the complimentary eggs and beansprouts. Pleasant place to dine in with kids. Hope to see more selection of ramen choices in the menu.
Keisuke Ramen,"Pleasant experience here for dinner. Ordered 2 different ramen along with a side of gyoza. Service was pleasant, with a auntie patiently explaining the difference between the tonkotsu king and the normal ramen broth. I highly appreciated how they had a kids portion of the noodles, which is suitable for people with small appetites. This is something more places should offer. By having a smaller portion available, we were able to try the side dishes of gyoza and even has space for dessert. Much better than having to order a standard sized portion and end up jelat.  Highly recommended!"
Keisuke Ramen,"Food: I think… this might be the best ramen in Singapore. If I had to marry and settle down with a bowl of ramen, this would be it… yeah I’m not joking. The broth is perfect. There’s free flow eggs. They used to not cut the egg but now do it like other ramen shops do. You can choose soup thickness, noodle hardness, it’s great. Big and generous portions, you’ll never be hungry. Free flow hard boiled eggs and chili bean sprouts. If I can give 10 stars out of 5 I would Service: Love the unique ordering paper, it’s very cool. Food arrives quickly, expect long queues (and little seating). Getting reward points (like other Keisuke branches) always need mobile number (why not just scan?). Small issue though. Sesame seeds are not always given, like they used to back at International Plaza. Atmosphere: The current location is a lot smaller and more functional than the former original beautiful and cozy location at International Plaza which really feels like you’re stepping into a Japanese pocket dimension with the cool wooden sliding door. Not that it’s bad for first timers coming here. I blame the rental market!"
Keisuke Ramen,"Everything is still on point for this ramen, high on our favorite list, the soup is impressively rich with the springy noodles, the meat is soft and tender, ramen eggs were perfectly runny at the yolk, seaweed just seasoned nicely. Can try the black or red spicy if u love spicy stuff! Best part is free unlimited beansprouts and hard boiled eggs, what else can u ask for when we are in singapore? Highly recommended, die die have to try! Kids eat for free when a adult order, so thoughtful, not to mention service is good as well!"
Keisuke Ramen,"Wow, I really like the ramen here. It's my first time trying this branch, but the broth just hits all the right spots - I had the spicy black version, but it's really not that spicy at all. It's not overly viscous and doesn't leave you feeling thirsty (well, not as much as some other places I know), and the flavours are simply sublime. The pork slice and flavored egg didn't let down as well, and given the pricing I really can't think of a better option at that moment. Definitely keeping this place as my top go-to ramen option for now, and I can't wait to bring my wife here next time. :face_savoring_food:"
Keisuke Ramen,"Expected long queue during peak hours. Foods are delicious, for dine in get complimentary boiled eggs & bean sprout. Shop is quite small."
Keisuke Ramen,"Free flow of hard boiled eggs. No availability of ramen eggs with semi solid yolk. Customizable soup intensity and hardness of noodles. The hard texture was superb. Pork slice was ok.  It’s not mindblowing or memorable, good option where there is no queue. Around $15-16 per pax."
Keisuke Ramen,"The soup wasn't serve hot, its was just warm. Ordered 2 x rich soup. 1 normal, 1 stronger taste (salty). The taste wasn't strong at all. Tasted very bland.  Chicken is tender but lack of taste.  Service was alright."
Keisuke Ramen,"Affordable ramen with free flow hard boiled egg and bean sprout. Interesting broth flavours as I tried the green wasabi, and I enjoyed the kick. The chicken is tender so it’s easy to bit them off despite it being a drumstick.  There could be better table management in terms of seating as we spotted a couple of 4 tables seats taken up by two people , while there are some two tables seats left empty, This we had to wait for very long before we get in. Overall service was alright."
Keisuke Ramen,"Ordered Tori King Ramen and the basic Ramen Both in Rich Soup. You can choose your level of saltiness, your doneness of noodle and add extra ingredients to your ramen. You can also choose to remove ingredients that you don’t like, like spring onions. The basic ramen comes with a huge chicken drum stick and black fungus but the king version has chicken balls, seaweed, chicken meat and an onsen egg. We chose “normal” for every option and didn’t add or remove any ingredients. The eatery also provides free bean sprouts and hard boiled eggs at the table. There aren’t any sides available on the menu. Kids 10 and under get to eat free so it’s a good deal for families.  I’ve eaten several versions of Tori ramen from different places. And I’ve gotten pretty used to rich collagen chicken soup, so my expectations are a bit high. The rich soup was nice but a tad less rich than I had thought it would be. Portions are really good, and even big eaters will be filled up by all the hard boiled eggs which you can cut and soak in the soup to soften the yolks. They also provide sesame seeds which you can grind yourself and add to your ramen. Chili powder, chili oil and other flavorings are provided on the side for your own adding pleasure lol. The chicken meat was super tender, it practically fell off the bone. The chicken balls were nice with an interesting flavour, they might have added pickles to it? Overall a nice place to have a fuss free meal at."
Keisuke Ramen,A good place to get chicken ramen with rich broth.  Each bowl comes with a full drumstick :poultry_leg:. Size of the drumstick has decreased significantly.  The queue is constant and expect to wait some time for yr seats.  Comes with free flow bean sprouts and hard boil egg and ice water.  The Yuzu cola taste chemical and is not natural.  Only 2 service staff but the service was fast but not friendly.
Keisuke Ramen,"Ramen Keisuke Tori King is hands down the best place for Chicken Ramen! The authenticity of their dishes is simply outstanding. The chicken is incredibly tender and juicy, while the broth is perfection itself - thick, flavorful, and absolutely delicious. What's even better is that you can customize your ramen to your liking, ensuring a personalized experience. The dine-and-go concept is convenient, but if you choose to dine in, you're treated to unlimited boiled eggs and bean sprouts, adding a delightful touch.  The menu offers a great variety of ramen options to choose from, and the service is top-notch. The staff is efficient, friendly, and truly knows their stuff. If you're a ramen lover, don't miss out on Ramen Keisuke Tori King - it's an absolute gem!"
Keisuke Ramen,Had lunch at keisuke jcube basement branch Keisuke ramen has been my favourite ramen chain for a long time usually I eat at the holland village or suntec branch Broth is very good a little on the salty side (i like my broth saltier) but at certain branches u can adjust the broth to your liking either heavier or lighter $9.90 for tonkotsu ramen with huge char siew. noodles have strong integrity good bite
Keisuke Ramen,"Though Keisuke is still one of my favourite ramen, i have to give 1 star for JCube stall. The staff have very bad attitude, i think its reflects on other peoples comments on the staff.  1. He was very rude on responding to my wife question and request 2. He slams the can tea when he gave it to us like we owe him money 3. When i ask whether he has chili powder, he gave me a mountain of chilli powder without asking (and yes with his rude face as well) and have to waste the chilli powder as shown in pic  For Keisuke team, im the customer bought ramen with receipt number 135419 today 7 May 2023. I would suggest to review the staff before re-assign him to other keisuke branch (as JCube will close down soon), else it will impact your reputation."
Keisuke Ramen,"The cook had an attitude. Although i was the only customer at that time and he is halfway preparing my food. He commanded that i go back to my seat to wait for the buzzer. I hesitated knowing very likely that it will buzz before i reach my seat. Then he commanded that i stand away from the collection point.  10sec later, the buzzer went off…..  Ask nicely. You are in a service industry. Nobody owe you a living."
Keisuke Ramen,"Standards have improved to my liking , went today on a thursday, 27072023."
Keisuke Ramen,"Took the day off to bring the little ones for the Brickman exhibition and popped by here for lunch. My kids are ramen kiddos so decided to have Keisuke ramen. When I went to collect the noodles, to my surprise, Daniel had ready 2 small bowls for my kiddos to share the noodles. I didn't specify it earlier so I was very very awed by the level of customer service that Daniel had. He actually observed every customer to cater to their needs. Very few back of counter staff will actually do that. Kudos to Daniel for the great service! (My kids also loved the noodles. Definitely will come back for more.)"
Keisuke Ramen,Tried the Tonkotsu original which was really good the char siew was great! And well balanced with the meat and fat had the soda as well which was kinda allright could go without that and I really like the amount of condiments available and there’s egg as well and the bean sprouts definitely would recommend!
Keisuke Ramen,"I’m not a fan of duck. And not a fan of meat these days. Ordered a spicy ramen with eggs only (no meat )  . The broth of the ramen soup has a “duck” taste ( which is what this place is all about. Having duck as the main ingredient . ) we are given eggs and bean sprouts as starters. What I like about the place is that it’s located at 2nd floor, I love the way up the stairs, the small little cosy restaurant away from the crowd.  It can’t accommodate a lot of people. ( less than 20 at any time - partly due to SMM ) Food is served pretty promptly. Service is good, staff refilled my water at least 3 times . For duck lovers , give it a try !"
Keisuke Ramen,Cozy restaurant with lovely staff and amazing food. Original ramen with eggs is the one to go. You can customise the broth thickness but the thickest is the best!
Keisuke Ramen,"Food is good. Cashless payment only. Seating/ordering policy is rigid and bizzare.  There was a family of 3, where the dad and two children came to the restaurant to eat. They made their orders already and the mother wanted to drop in last minute to join them for dinner. She was asked to sit elsewhere when there were other tables that could have accommodated the 4 of them. The hall manager simply refused to let them switch to a larger table, citing that they had asked for a table for 3 persons initially, and refused to let the mother join the group to dine on the same table, saying that this is the rule of the restaurant. The dad was so furious he paid for their food and then they left. It is certainly bizzare.  In our case, the hall manager was friendly and took our orders promptly.  The food is delicious, thick ramen soup, tender charsu for a reasonable price."
Keisuke Ramen,"Recommend: Tonkotsu special  Great hidden gem in Holland Village. Free flow boiled eggs.  Tonkotsu Special was flavourful, noodles were firm, charsiew was thinly sliced and had a good balance of lean meat and fattiness.  Service was prompt and efficient"
Keisuke Ramen,"Really like to Gyoza place. Setup like a Ramen Shop, but they serve Gyoza with Rice instead.  The set includes a set of 5 Gyoza, Unlimited Rice and 2 side dishes. Love their Egg Omlette, Stir fried Pork and deep fried prawn mayonnaise sides"
Keisuke Ramen,"Fast and simple. Delicious and fresh. However, prawn gyoza is slightly too salty for my likey. Other than that, everything was good. Oh! The air ventilation is not very strong. So, be sure u are prepared to smell oily."
Keisuke Ramen,"The mapo tofu set is incredibly satisfying. The tofu is soft and silky, mapo sauce is spicy and thick which goes well with the rice. Yes, you can choose pick a huge portion of rice, up to the 400g of rice. And add another egg to mix with mapo tofu and rice to increase richness and reduce the spiciness. The gyozas are good too, I would pick the miso instead of vegetable soup."
Keisuke Ramen,Gyoza is good.. set meal well priced with a good portion. Setup is super jap… very nice but smoky and tight… food is delicious. Prepare to queue.
Keisuke Ramen,"Hair and clothing tend to smell of food due to poor ventilation.  Food is good. There are quite a variety of side dish to choose from. Would recommend eggs, ginger pork and eggplant (if you like them) as side dish."
Keisuke Ramen,My favourite outlet at Parkway Parade closed down. Came here to get my ramen. Reasonably priced but very good. Just missing the sesame seed dispenser.
Keisuke Ramen,"Fantastic, I'm always impressed with Keisuke ramen not only for their ramen, but their complimentary eggs and bean sprout. It makes you feel like ure dining in someone-you-know's house."
Keisuke Ramen,Love that the restaurant offers kids eat for free deal.. helps family with some savings.. moreover the ambience is very nice and better than other ramen restaurants.. service is quick too.. will definitely visit this ramen restaurant branches in future..
Keisuke Ramen,"The staff was friendly and attentive, providing helpful recommendations. As for the ramen itself, it was a burst of flavor in every bite. The broth was rich and perfectly balanced, the noodles were cooked to perfection, and the toppings were fresh and delicious."
Keisuke Ramen,Great dining experience! Enjoyed the lobster broth ramen with free flow hard boil egg and bean sprout!
Yakiniku Go,"Recently visited this Yakiniku store in Serangoon NEX, and overall, it was a satisfying experience. The restaurant has fast service, comfortable seating, friendly staff, and deliciously marinated meat. However, the limited choice of sauces left me wishing for more variety.  Firstly, the service provided was commendable. The staff was prompt, efficient, and attentive.  The restaurant itself offered a comfortable and inviting setting. The seating arrangements were well-spaced, providing enough privacy while still allowing for a lively atmosphere.  The cuts were well-marinated, tender, and bursting with flavor. The grilling experience was delightful.  However, one aspect that fell short was the limited selection of sauces. While the marinated meat was tasty on its own, having a wider variety of sauces to complement the different flavors would have added another dimension to the dining experience. It would be wonderful if they could expand their sauce options, providing customers with more choices to enhance their meal.  In conclusion, this Yakiniku store in Serangoon NEX offers a pleasant dining experience with its fast service, comfortable seating, friendly staff, and deliciously marinated meat. The only issue to me is the limited sauce selection."
Yakiniku Go,First time eating here! Ordered 3 sets for 2 adults and 2 kiddos. 3 rice and plenty of meat! Good experience! Nice food and portion! Total damage ard $70+. I'll let the pics do the talkings! :star-struck::thumbs_up:
Yakiniku Go,"This affordable BBQ restaurant is always the best choice for my family. Nowadays we can see similar kind of cheap YAKINIKU store, but I can say Yakiniku Go is the best for us. The sauce is pretty nice taste and good with the meat. Especially rib eye steak and Jo Karubi are good."
Yakiniku Go,"Ordered the beef short plate set meal (200g), it was a little pricey for its portion (felt 80% full afterwards).  Meat was sliced thin & well marinated, perfect for a short grill. Sides had only 3 options, either kimchi, radish kimchi or salad; nothing really mind-blowing.  Only felt that the table was squeezy for 3 pax, would be perfect for 2."
Yakiniku Go,"Positive experience at Yakiniku-GO!  First time dining here the place is clean, efficient and offer affordable yakiniku experience.  Raw meat served with sauce marinates. Set meal also comes with 2 dipping sauces, rice, side dish (kimchi) and soup. Meat quality is good imo. Many different cuts and meat available. Quantity is sufficient and I don’t have small appetite.  Overall very good dining experience and I’ll be back again."
Yakiniku Go,"I went with a few friends to try. The following are my findings (whatever i say are MY views, try not to be offended, you are free to agree or disagree):  Food portion: 3/5 I understand these are the so called premium meat. But need order more than a set to be full. Even if double set. Maybe i fat la idk.  Food quality: 4/5 Garlic chilli :thumbs_up::thumbs_up: Wagyu :thumbs_up: mushroom platter :thumbs_up:Double korubi :thumbs_up: steak :thumbs_up: kimchi :thumbs_down: veggie platter(either change or remove) :thumbs_down::thumbs_down::thumbs_down:  Food taste: Irrelevant Self cook is cook yourself, you cook good then nice. You cook not good then not nice, simple.  Location and size: 4.5/5 Super easy to find, alight from grab only the store name big big. But the restaurant kinda small imo  Waiting time/eating time: 3/5 Waiting time is usually tie to eating time. Longer you can eat in means the longer you have to wait. I understand this logic. Will carry on in the next pt.  Thought for Customer vs Business: 2/5 Doesnt allow booking, eating time short and waiting time not very long. All these shows they want to fit as many customer as possible. Not very good imo, it kinda shows the management dont really care about customer/staff happiness, just wanna make money. With tech nowadays, there should be a way to improve this if they want to. But of course it depends on whether management are willing to reduce the revenue for customer/staff happiness.  Customer service: 3/5 Not the best not gonna lie but not the worst either. I can feel the unhappiness of the people working there. But its not a surprise since they have to constantly face the backlash of the 50min eating time for a selfcooking restaurant. Im grateful some of them still smiled.  Overall: 3/5 Id still go if my friends jio but wouldnt initiate. Maybe i'll try other branches, hope that changes my opinion. :OK_hand:"
Yakiniku Go,No frills restaurant set-up but the simple menu spread is excellent. Every meat plate is deservingly nice to eat!
Yakiniku Go,"First time try Yakiniku Go since there is the weekday $9.90 promo going on and it wasn't a good experience at all! Let me explain why: From the point of sitting down to order until the food to arrive (which took about 10 to 20mins), the BBQ burner was EXTREMELY EXTREMELY hot (was set to level 3). We could feel the heat even after we moved away to lean back against the chair. I had to lower down to level 1 to feel less heat. I've been to other BBQ and grill places before but never had this bad experience. When the food finally arrived, they look fresh and that's the only good thing I can say about the entire experience. I then raised the BBQ burner to 5. We also ordered the grilled mushroom side dish (Kinoko Hoiru Yaki) however, this cause our our BBQ burner area was cut into half throughout the entire dining because the grilled mushroom is actually put onto our BBQ grill to be cooked! Because it took a long time for the BBQ burner to heat up to level 5 and that means the grilled mushroom side dish took a long time to cook! Nobody would want to eat undercooked mushrooms! Imagine having only half the BBQ area to grill the meat and is throughout your whole dining time! Since the BBQ burner heating took sometime to go up to the level fit to BBQ the meats, we were left waiting before we can properly start BBQ. The chunks of beef were the HARDEST to cook! Not all sides are evenly cooked so we had to flip multiple times for all sides to cook and to also ensure that it is not overcooked. Is just frustrating! Another frustrating point is since the meal is served with white rice and Kimchi, We can only eat white rice with kimchi while waiting for the BBQ burner to heat to the level where it is fit to cook the meat AND then need to wait for the meat to be cooked (especially the frustrating beef chunks). In summary, the combination of white rice, kimchi and BBQ meat (which took some time to be ready to eat) is just weird and wrong in so many areas! Even with the grilled mushroom (which again took a extremely long time to cook) doesn't help at all! My overall experience with Yakiniku Go is EXTREMELY BAD to the point that I would not even want to hear of the name ever again! Simply put, I will NEVER EVER go to any Yakiniku Go outlets EVER!!! Note: The above may sound like I'm prejudiced against Yakiniku Go by stating mostly negative points that is contradicting against other positive reviews here but this is my very true experience and you are welcome to experience it yourself to verify my points here and also see if other those positive reviews are indeed true. For me, it'll definitely be my first and last time unless things change drastically."
Yakiniku Go,Nice fuss free and easy yakiniku concept without breaking the bank. Each set is almost $18. Enough to feel not-hungry but definite will not be full. Flavour of meat is food. Grilling is easy. Nice seasonings on the side. Definitely will be back again. Oh and the ventilation is good. Was not stinky after leaving the restaurant.
Yakiniku Go,I enjoyed the food but the service has got to be better. Everyone there did not bother smiling. I’d appreciate if the staff would at least not slam our dishes on the table. Was served by a lady “VI” and she treated our table differently than the family opposite us. Not sure if this is because we’re non-Chinese & brown but the difference in treatment is obviously distinguishable and it just made our experience real bad. Never going back to this outlet again.
Yakiniku Go,Dinner with 2 adults and 2 kids. Really good experience. For once the table had ample space to put all the food. The sets are reasonably priced and filling. It had a good variety of meats on it and the kids liked it. They had fun grilling their own food. The adults shared a platter as neither of us wanted much carbs for dinner. And added veg and mushrooms. I did like the seasoning in the mushrooms.
Yakiniku Go,"Came on a Sunday evening by 6pm and the crowd levels were high, but enough to still get shown to the table upon reaching without queueing. Water is not  complimentary.  Food takes a while to come. Around 20 minutes after the order is sent to the kitchen. Perhaps it's due to shortage of manpower on the ground.  Food is generally slightly higher priced than the Lite version. But quality is pretty alright. Ordered the Beef & Pork bomb set and the Maze Beef Fat rice is very flavourful and extremely fragrant. Inside the ""bomb"" is wrapped with garlic chunks! Meat cuts were thick and marinate was a good choice. Ribeye steak was thick and very juicy."
Yakiniku Go,Have dined here a couple of times and never had a bad meal here. This particular GO+ outlet is the only one which offers wagyu on their menu. Diners get complimentary ice-cream at the end of their meal. We love the refreshing lime ice-cream. Special mention : great service from Wesley and Kevin!
Yakiniku Go,Value for Yakiniku joint with a full range of meal and meat options depending on one’s budget. Service is prompt and the online Q system is easy to navigate. They even give free ice cream to end your meal.
Yakiniku Go,"First of all, I was shocked at the size of the mega highball. It was truly MEGA, I reckon the volume of the mug is about 700ml. Very worth it imo and way cheaper than standard highballs in sg at $8.50 for a gigantic mug. Enjoyed the karubi and rice very much as well. I love that you can get just 100g of meat for when you’re not feeling too hungry."
Yakiniku Go,Located at B1 of Parkway Parade Shopping centre. Reasonably price. Sufficient seating space- the distance between tables are quite sufficiently spaced apart. The meat cuts were prepared till it looked quite appetising. Customers need to cook the meat to their liking. The staff was fast to send and clear the dishes. Overall experience was good! Would definitely come back again.
Yakiniku Go,Great food. Great atmosphere. Ordered the double Karubi set. However the place can be very cold due to the aircon blasting right to you.
Yakiniku Go,"Located at Parkway Parade, LYakiniku 焼き肉 commonly refers to a style of barbecuing bite-size meats, one of the most popular styles of cooking in Japan. Ordering at the restaurant is fuss-free and contactless: simply scan the QR code with your mobile device. Note that there is a 50 minutes dining limit.  Prices are value-for-money, starting with $9.80 for a Karubi or Beef & Chicken Set, which comes with rice, soup, kimchi or salad.  If you can’t decide what to order, here’s more:Tip: grill one side of the gyutan for a longer period and leave the other side slightly rare.  Over at Yakiniku-GO, the thickness of the beef tongue is determined after several rounds of R&D and the pieces also undergo a special processing step that ensures optimal bite and texture. Recommend to dip into the citrusy Negi Shio Tare. Overall a wonderful dining experience."
Yakiniku Go,2 visits in a week. Vicky from the Parkway Branch is a gem. Attentive and friendly service.  Value for money Karubi Sets. Also ordered their lamb and chicken. Choice of cuts are good for the price. Love the yuzu dip which cuts the grease. Enjoyable meal.
Yakiniku Go,"At this price, there is nothing you can’t like for a fuss-free yakiniku restaurant. It’s a fast food version. Don’t expect 5 stars quality for this price. Be realistic guys, if you are expecting a higher grade food, go to a proper Japanese restaurant. For this price in a heartland, it serves its purpose."
Yakiniku Go,"The warm and friendly demeanor made me feel right at home from the moment I stepped in. Thank you Andrea and Team!  The cleanliness of the space was truly remarkable, creating a pleasant and inviting atmosphere. It’s evident that you take great pride in maintaining a top-notch environment for your guests.  And I must say, the fresh pork/beef were an absolute delight! The flavors were rich and the meat was tender, making it a truly enjoyable dining experience.  Thank you once again for making my visit memorable and for your dedication to providing outstanding service. I’m looking forward to my next visit. :grinning_face:  The best part: No smell on my clothes and hair! I’ll definitely be back whenever I crave the grill!"
Yakiniku Go,"Been here twice, food is gd. However for the special menu items, there’s a need for some waiting time. Still love coming here ! Tried the lamb yakiniku , taste alright but it’s overly thin slice."
Yakiniku Go,"Clean and comfortable place to dine in. Affordable meat selection available in the menu. Service was good, from the supervisor to the cashier and waitstaff. Will be back again"
Yakiniku Go,"Reliable & consistent great yakiniku like other Yakiniku-GO outlets, certainly value for your grills!"
Yakiniku Go,Nicely renovated new outlet with helpful service staff. Food is on the pricer side for what is a small portion.
Yakiniku Go,"Reek of sweet char smell of meat waft into the orifice as the meat sizzles on the BBQ grill net. When the melting fats drip onto the heating elements, it ignites a tantalising and alluring flame that engulfs the meat on the grill. Remarkable place to dine with spacious seating."
Yakiniku Go,A place for affordable yakiniku. Service is quick and I would recommend the double karubi. I usually order the double portions because I’m a meat lover and single is too little for me. I’ve tried the lean meat before but in the end I always go back for the karubi which is a fatter cut.
Yakiniku Go,Came here on a Friday evening and had to get a queue number on the spot which pinged my phone via WhatsApp once my number was called. Waited about 20 mins with 2 groups infront of me. Sadly water is not complimentary unlike their sister brand ichiban. Bottled water is sold here.  Value sets are available and a good amount of variety as well. There is a choice of 1 side and a miso soup which wasn't that delicious and portions were really small. Wakame in the soup was plenty though.  Meat has a sauce slathered over it which caramelised well when cooking. Mushroom side is a must order. Goes amazing with rice. The yam and zucchini side is an acquired taste.  Would come here again. But feels like a very individual dining experience. Not much customer service involved other than getting the bill.
Yakiniku Go,Went there for bday celebration however they limit for 50 mins. Food not too bad so if u r someone who dun really eat rice then the meat portion can order 200g. No reservation for now & all of u have to turn up before you get a seat.
Yakiniku Go,Clean and safe place but food quality is far from good compared to its competitor Yakiniku-Like. The beef used here is very very average.  But overall good experience with polite staffs!
Yakiniku Go,"Was recommended by a friend about how fresh and its affordable meal as compared to other Japanese bbq restaurants. It does live up to its name. As the restaurant limit their diners, a 50-minute dining, you dont have to wait very long even if the queue is long. In about 30 to 40 minutes, you can get seats during a weekend lunch."
Yakiniku Go,"Ordered the Go Set ($22.80), Double Karubi ($17.80), 100g Karubi ($6.90), and 100g Ribeye ($5.90).  It's pretty cheap per-gram if compared eating in a steak house. Overall good environment, good food, and good service. Would recommend if you're in the area!"
Yakiniku Go,Nice place. Set menu are worth it. Meat quality is top notch! Smoke free BBQ. Won’t let you leave smelling like a bbq grill. Meat is juicy and tender after grilling. Top with rice and let the fats drip into the rice. Set comes with choice of salad or kimchi. Drinks are not included. Soup is included in set. Economical pricing. Choose from basic set menu or premium set menu for better quality meat. No bookings. Walk in only and expect queue during peak hours. Definitely 1 of my favourites now!
Yakiniku Go,"Great concept of bringing affordable yakiniku to the masses. Menu can come across as beef heavy although lamb, chicken, and seafood options are available. Wagyu is available. Ingredients are fresh but portion is small. Grilling is diy and smoke control is pretty good. Service crews were attentive."
Yakiniku Go,"Very decent Japanese BBQ chain!  As it’s name suggests, they do have a dine-in limit of 50 minutes per table, which actually is more than sufficient, given that the meals here are individually prepared, and are cooked within minutes.  Prices are rather affordable, but could add up really fast once you start ordering the ala carte dishes (100g of chicken at $3.90, super worth it!)  Will definitely return, given the quality and price! :thumbs_up_light_skin_tone:"
Tenya,The food was as good as it can be. Miss traveling to Japan for the same dish! Really enjoyed it. It was perfectly prepared/cooked! Exactly how it should be! Really enjoyed it to the last bite. My comfort food all time! Thank you for keeping it authentic.
Tenya,"I had a very lovely meal here today. We were there at about 5pm. The food was well prepared. The Iced Green tea was also fragrant! But most importantly, service provided by the part-time Chinese lady staff member was very attentive and very helpful! Thank you so much for the wonderful service rendered! Looking forward to our next visit there again!!:grinning_face_with_big_eyes::folded_hands_light_skin_tone::sparkles::thumbs_up_light_skin_tone:"
Tenya,Generous serving. Tempura is freshly fried so suggest you eat it quickly before it turns oily. Soba noodle is normal and comes in big portion.  Generally nice place for more value option in the area.
Tenya,"The food was good, but it took too long to arrive, so it's hard to wholeheartedly recommend.  Food I tried:  Salmon tendon: 7/10. The individual ingredients are nice, especially the mushroom tempura. I decided to have less rice (which is $0.50 cheaper), but I think it's too little rice for the portion of ingredients. Not the best tempura I tried, but quite good.  Okra tempura: 6/10.  This place is popular—even around 2 PM, I had to queue around 25 minutes outside before being seated.  You need to order via a website, but this site is clunky, and the images load very slowly.  The food also took around 20 minutes to arrive. I liked it, but I wish my experience here was smoother."
Tenya,"Used to be value for money and quality standard was great. But during my visit on 14 May 2023, the hot soba was not warm enough and the tempura has lost its crispness. Also, noticed price has increased for example, the price of the soft serve ice cream has nearly doubled. It was indeed upsetting to see good establishment like this going downhill. Hope the quality can be improved to justify the increase in price."
Tenya,"Chanced upon this tempura place. I would say it is good. I would return! Especially for when we can order both soba or udon together with rice. I mean, best of both world! The avocado and corn was slightly disappointing as the serving were so little as seen. For mentai fries, could’ve more sauce but other than that, no complains!"
Tenya,"Very nice Tempura with crispy flour coating. The oysters are juicy and hot. Octopus legs are fried to just nice with a little dip of lime which level up the freshness. The enoki mushroom is a must to have. Prawns are slightly overcooked, but very big piece. Love the sweet potato and the pumpkin, very sweet. Love the cold soba, very refreshing and the portion is just nice."
Tenya,"Waited around 30 minutes for a table on a weekday evening dinner time. There were only 2 ground staffs hence the service was bit slow. Ordered premium tempura bowl with cold soba and surprisingly the soba was the star of the night. Oddly the premium tempura comes with a crab stick. They should replace it with fresh seafood instead of frozen food. The cold spicy udon was a refreshing take on udon, worth trying if you like ur noodles spicy."
Tenya,Super impressed with the food here! Tempura was absolutely delicious - crunchy and freshly fried with the right amount of savouriness… so perfect paired with refreshing cold soba. Don’t think you’d go wrong ordering anything else from the menu either.  Had to wait a while for a table on a Thursday evening. The website on which to place orders (by scanning a QR code) was wonky and problematic but a helpful waiter assisted us by submitting the order on his own phone. Thanks!
Tenya,"Affordable tempura tendon set you can get at orchard!  Be prepared to queue but the queue moves very fast. Just that the time to get your food is quite looong. They also have a 1 hour duration limit but maybe it’s not implemented as waiting for the food to arrive takes time.  There’s also complimentary water machine so that’s nice and cute!  It’s one of the best tempuras I’ve had, love the sauce really elevates the whole dining experience.  Can’t wait to come again."
Tenya,"Had a very good experience dining here for the first time today. Familiar with this chain from Tokyo and it’s set up to make you feel like you’re in Japan, with automated ordering and self service. The portion sidings are generous for the price and quality is very good. Drinks are free flow and so are the fried tempura crumbs. All self served as well at the various counters."
Tenya,"This is my go-to fuss free tendon chain when i’m in Tokyo. They are cheap and good and easily everywhere in Japan. So i was kinda excited when i saw an outlet in Parkway which is close to where i live. I like that they have those bar seats and countertop table which is quintessential of Japan. Sit down tables are usually packed during lunch time so if like me you don’t mind the countertop it’s not an issue. Price is still reasonable. The signature tendon is only $9.50 ala carte. They have set meals that’s like about 4 bucks more that comes with an extra portion of cold soba. Carbs with carbs, so not sure what they are thinking when they are curating the set menu. Anyway I went big and ordered the prawn tendon which comes with 3 pieces of shrimps. The batter is not as crispy as i thought it would be. The teriyaki sauce which they provide is also not as flavorful. Not the most ideal bowl of tendon. But overall for the price i wouldn’t complain. Got my tendon craving satisfied without breaking my wallet!"
Tenya,"Just open not long ago! Decided to give it a try. Like there are self check out counters with pictures. many things are self-serviced which is also really helpful as you can take what you need.  The tendon was delicious. I order less rice and is just enough for me. It came with Crabstick, 2 prawns, pumpkin, lotus, squid, or fish (not quite sure but is tasty), and long beans. Love that there is also single seating available! One highlight is that they put the tempura sauce on the table so you can just add how much you want! Will come back here again for good tendon, tempura, and soba!  Water is free and free flow. Tea is $2 and is free flow!"
Tenya,One of the best tempera ever tasted ! Big big prawn :shrimp: and really authentic freshly made tempera taste drenched with just right amount of sauce. I asked for lesser rice and it turns out just :star-struck: :thumbs_up: perfect. Great place for tempera lovers.  Really worth a bang for the buck! It was lesser than 10 dollars
Tenya,Served nice and affordable tendon. But most of the tables are still unclean when we go in while there is actually not much people eating there. Staff has no initiative to clean the place.
Tenya,"DO NOT come here unless you're willing to wait over an hour, though the food still tastes decent.  As a regular of their Orchard and Somerset outlets, the service here fell miserably short. Little fault of the staff, but more of a group management issue - the restaurant is severely understaffed, and I spotted only 1-2 people cooking the entire time.  They have a self order kiosk that's always manned by a staff member (with the other kiosks turned off). They only have inefficient, disposable cutlery for dine-in (including a flat spoon?) that isn't even specified to be recycled. There only appeared to be 5-6 staff in the entire place. On top of this, they were still taking constant take out orders when dine-in customers had empty tables - my receipt stated I ordered/paid at 18:06, and I got my food at 19:12, despite the staff telling me the wait would be 'about 30 minutes'(appreciate the heads up, but the actual wait time was more than double).  On one hand, the food wasn't compromised, and the taste is on par with their other outlets, just as good (despite a mix-up between the sets that jumbled items from both up). On the other, please don't open when you're understaffed or unprepared.  I hope the waiting issue is resolved when we return. Almost the entire dining area was turning to look at the kitchen frequently, which shows that the crowds were familiar with the brand's efficient service and were let down."
Tenya,"July 2023  Bright & Airy. The ordering system is a bit wonky but the guys & gals there did their best to help. Both our orders were quite good for the price. As with any new establishment, they need time to settle. We definitely will come back again."
Tenya,Although it was a long wait but the food made up for it. Just don't try to come during peak hour
Tenya,Finally able to eat this as it's always a long queue since opening. Ordered the rice and noodles set. Good portion and value for money. The only con I find is the sitting arrangement. The staff should allocate the seats and not let the customer decide. I see table for 4  with only 1 or 2 diners. Not maximising the space and turning away many people too.
Tenya,Waiting time for food is a bit long compared to the shop on ION.  I like the cold UDON or soba. The tempura is not oily . And ingredients are fresh. I think consider top few tempura in singapore .
Nantsuttei,"Surprised to find the price cheaper than the usual ones outside. Ordered the recommended, most basic to try out. The broth was light but flavorful. It doesn't give that greasy after taste and the portion (small) was just right for ladies. If there's one thing worth mentioning besides the price point, it's the fabulous generous amount of beansprouts as part of the ingredients in this bowl of wholesomeness. They simply gave a good crunch without disrupting the taste of the broth and ramen. This is definitely delightful for people who love beansprouts!"
Nantsuttei,"What used to be my favourite ramen place has fallen down the ranks this year. We visited after quite some time away, just recently this month in July 2023. The broth is now no longer thick, full bodied, but a little flat and maybe even diluted. I always go for hard noodles so that’s fine, and the char Siew is nothing to shout about — so it’s quite sad to taste a soup base that’s no longer as “oomph”.  Doesn’t come with egg, seaweed size has also shrunk significantly."
Nantsuttei,"Really, REALLY good ramen. I’m quite a ramen nerd so I’m pretty critical when I try a new place but this is just delicious. The soup is rich and incredibly flavourful, the noodles have a nice bite to them, and the toppings don’t disappoint.  The only thing I didn’t really like was how expensive the egg was, and the chashu looked a lot more seared in the photos than it was on my actual bowl, but still a wonderful choice nonetheless"
Nantsuttei,"First time eating at this ramen restaurant. Happened to pass by and hungry. Ramen soup base quiteb think with pork broth. Generous spread of spring onion on top of ramen. Those who like spicy ramen can try the different spicy level.  We did level 2, OK lah,  not spicy enough. Had pork ramen in garlic soup base. Had to add more chilli powder,  a lot to get my pteference. You can choose how you want your noodle to be cooked and the size of bowl.  Prices reasonable."
Nantsuttei,"Very flavorful ramen with other lovely dishes. I especially enjoyed the tomato flavored ramen, very tasty. Highly recommended if you happen to hang out in Orchard Central and looking for good food."
Man Man Unagi,"Unagi taste good and flavourful but definitely not the best... maybe if given more time to savour other dishes (was given only 40 mins to dine in for my group of 3 pax), we could have given a more accurate review :thinking_face:"
Man Man Unagi,"Great place for have a perfectly grilled unagi, they used just the best quality eels  Grilled and marinated well before serving  There is 3 options for you to enjoy the meal, first: just eat the unagi with rice, second : put some condiments and mixed it together, the last one is pouring the broth in to the bowl and ejoy it like a soup.  Great place, great food, great service"
Man Man Unagi,"Very delicious and authentic grilled unagi like I had it last time in Nagoya . Crispy skin and soft meat coated  with the sweet sauce, so appetising. Craving to have it again. But, limited space and suggest to visit during not peak lunch or dinner time"
Man Man Unagi,"The hatsumabushj set is considered good in SG and served fast(sth must be wrong). Getting your own Fresh mustard ready is fun and amazing. The quality of the eel is normal, aka not fatty, but taste of unagi is good though chef uses expedited way(pre-grill eel before ordering and add sauce less frequently) to cook. Same goes for the dashi soup. Expedited way of cooking make both with less umami than expected. The pickle and miso soup are good and matches well with others. While for the liver, it is not recommended due to unstable quality. Overall, the price falls a bit on the expensive side given the portion. Free flow drinks is a bonus. Service, ehh normal Singapore level. Also, can see live eel at the entrance."
Man Man Unagi,"Unagi is very delicious!!!!!! No queue on weekday night :) total for two people is 80+, not too cheap but okay for yummy unagi"
Man Man Unagi,"Okay guys, my 4th time eating man man unagi, my 1st time at the central outlet.  Went to the keong saik outlet and there’s a queue, so decided to drive to this place. There’s no queue! The taste is definitely the same as what I’ve eaten 4 years ago, great! Although the price increased, but that’s expected.  Highly recommend this store as it taste super good for its large bowl!"
Man Man Unagi,"The hype for Man Man has died down for awhile now. Perhaps it's the lack of new marketing or due to the somewhat confused value proposition especially with this outlet being in the basement (traditionally reserved for cheaper establishments in malls) and the menu's tacky design.  However, having it again after a while reminds me of just how excellent Man Man is. I had the large Roast Beef with Unagi Hitsumaboshi which ended up being a bit of a mistake given how thoroughly filled I was. The portion is much larger than it looks. The dish was a blast to consume, not just because of how tasty it was, but the progression of having it on its own, to having it with the various levels of accompaniments advised as ""the correct way"" by the restaurant's little placard on the table, just added so much diversity to the palate that you can barely find a repeated flavour in each bite before you end.  The beef was perfectly cooked and tender and the unagi was perfectly fatty and sauced. The bones were so soft that I'd hazard a bet that even those who have a fear of eel bones wouldn't have a problem with the unagi here. As you add the first level of accoutrements with the wasabi, negi and shredded nori, the freshness and mild spice of the negi and wasabi help to cut through the intensity of the sauce to add a fun brightness to the dish.  Subsequently, the Dashi, which has a very mild saltiness but a deep fish umami, helps to mellow out the intensity of the unagi sauce's rich sweet saltiness yet accentuate its savoriness in a chazuke-style texture.  Finally, adding on the tempura bits helps to add an interesting textural variance to the tenderness of the beef and the unagi especially after having them with the rice in a porridge-y manner in the broth earlier.  The interior decor is nice with the right level of dimness and space between tables to maximize diners' comfort.  The service, while a little understaffed, was attentive too although the kitchen staff could try to keep their chatter a little lower especially since the interior decor seems to suggest that they intended for diners to enjoy a quieter experience.  All of the above was enjoyed at a price point of about SGD25 to SGD35 per pax which seems steep at first but given the quality of food, the large portions, amidst a backdrop of global inflation as of mid-2023, I find the joint to be perfectly reasonable and great value for money.  All in all, highly recommended!"
Man Man Unagi,Tried the Hitsumsbushi set. Unagi is grill just right. Crispy on the outside and tender inside. The soup comes with a 陈皮taste. Very good experience.
Man Man Unagi,23/06/23 Ordered large unagi with rice. Slices are thicker but skins are less crispy compared with another similar restaurant at Keong Saik. Flavour wise not as delicious as I had expected. The restaurant is located at the level (B1) same as Don Don Donki. Portion considered small for large size.
Man Man Unagi,"Recommended by my friend. There are 4 ways to eat Hitsumabushi, I like the 4th one the most: Eat it with AGE-SAMA. Also I like the soup (broth?) the most!!! Really delicious!!"
Man Man Unagi,A smaller branch of the popular unagi restaurant. Quality not as good as the main outlet at Keong Saik Street. Tried the white unagi and found it to be rather bland. Was overall passable but lacked the oomph to stand out. Ambience not as good as Keong Saik outlet as well.
Man Man Unagi,Lunch is of good portion. Quality is fine but the soup is only lukewarm. Atmosphere is good but the space is a bit crowded
Man Man Unagi,"Such a satisfying meal! We came on Thursday, 6pm sharp when the store opened for dinner and there was no crowd or queue. We had the beef and unagi hitsumabushi set. The beef was good, but nothing could beat the unagi. We quickly wished we only ordered just the unagi. The unagi was so flavourful and had a nice grilled taste. The wasabi provided also tasted fresh and different from your typical sushi shop wasabi paste! We loved the unagi so much that we ordered another Kabayaki. The restaurant can get a little hot, depending on where you are sitting. They also do not accept cash payment. Highly recommended for the unagi hitsumabushi!"
Man Man Unagi,"Went for the set as I was quite excited to finally try man man after so many years of hype. For about $35, I feel it’s quite pricey for what it is.  Maybe it’s the overly hyped expectation from myself but don’t get me wrong- it is a good bowl of unagi don. Well barbequed and marinated. Good portion as well. I just felt that it’s not terribly outstanding at this price point.  Ambience definitely does not feel premium so don’t do your date nights here otherwise you might not get to have the next one."
Man Man Unagi,"Very nice unagi and not too expensive. Cost us 120 total, but that is with alcohol and an extra piece of unagi. Unagi was very fresh and tasty. There is extra sauce on the table, which is a nice touch. Miso soup was very nice as well. Extra toppings on the side and some Wasabi. Great lunch and great staff here that are very friendly."
Shimbashi Soba,"Quality & Taste : 5/5 Variety: 5/5 Affordability: 3/5 Will I come back again: Yes  My second time here. Tried their soba noodles the other time and it came with the soba water that apparently has very good health benefits.  Came again today to try something else. We accidentally ordered the noodle and rice lunch set because we didn’t read it carefully. Tempura items was REALLY GOOD, light and crispy, probably the best I have tried. Portions are huge, taste was good and service was good & fast.  Although when I wanted to use my voucher the manager(assuming from the clothing) was unsure and kept running to the back and when he talks he mumbles so soft. Had to kept asking him to repeat himself. Probably a new manager."
Shimbashi Soba,"Good for a soba place but don’t expect Japanese quality soba. Taste and servings are acceptable. Overall, it’s a decent place.  What I like: decent servings, taste of soba soup was superb, decent amount of toppings too, the egg was yummy  What I didn’t like: -the waiting time: from being seated to serving our food Haha -Our chicken teriyaki side dish arrived almost halfway we’re done so that’s disappointing (even if the order slip indicated “serve first”) -noodles was not cut well (3 strands stuck together, some strands shorter than others)"
Shimbashi Soba,"I’m usually expecting to be disappointed when there’s some fuss over a place, but this was surprisingly good. Soba had a nice bite, tempura was fried well (better than some tempura establishments actually). The dipping broth for the cold soba was rather salty imo. Didn’t try the hot broth one, but no complaints from my dining partner either.  Only thing marring the experience was that they were short staffed on a PH, and couldn’t properly serve customers. Not too much wait time, but got a lot of hurried albeit apologetic service, which dented the experience.  Tl;dr: good, would return, but feeling salty. :face_with_tears_of_joy:"
Shimbashi Soba,"Service 5/5 Food 4.5/5  There was a queue during weekday lunch hour but once seated, ordering was done through the waitress and food came reasonably fast.  I enjoyed the kimchi chicken warm soba. The balance between kimchi and broth was just right for me. Kimchi quantity was also sufficient.  My friend’s soba felt like there was a little too much fried stuff and got a little gelak after a while.  I was most impressed with a bespectacled lady server with a pony tail. She was courteous, knowledgeable and efficient. She would explain that the refillable tea served was hojicha instead or matcha and even asked if we would like to have our cake bought from outside prepared by the staff or not.  We were grateful not to be charged a “cakeage” fee and therefore chose to set up the cake ourselves. She was quick to prepare 2 small plates, forks and a lighter. Thank you for the great service.  I would return to try other items in the menu!"
Shimbashi Soba,Finally was able to resist the lure of din tai feng and try out some handmade soba! Very yummy with great service.  Although I was the dummy that tried to look for ways to have a low carb meal at a soba shop. Luckily soba noodle itself is relatively low net carb. And can add on more sashimi to get some more proteins into your meal. Ignore this if you’re just looking to enjoy a good meal ;)
Sanpoutei,"The dipping noodles were delicious! It’s quite salty, but the flavor is really umami and nice. I did miss some protein as it didn’t come with any meat whatsoever, just some bits in the dipping sauce. I’d still come back for these noodles though :).  One star deduction because the waiting queue was pretty long (30 minutes) even though there were plenty of available tables. Probably the staff was at capacity."
Sanpoutei,Been wanting to try this popular ramen place but the queue is always very long during meal times. Passed by around 5pm on a Sunday with no queue & quickly got a table. The food definitely did justice to the hype about the place. The best ramen soup base we had in Singapore. Char Siew were sliced thickly & charred with torch. The chopped garlic & onions really added a lot of flavour to the soup. Noodles were cooked al dente with the right portion size. They have quite a good variety of ramen & other food dishes on the menu which we will definitely come back to try.
Sanpoutei,I had to wait about 20mins for dinner. Location is good: closed to cinema and orchard mrt and shopping centers. Staffs are very friendly and helpful. Had to wait about 15-20mins for foods to arrive. I ordered spicy miso ramen with extra full topping and it was too much for me to finish the whole bowl. I ordered salad with pork belly slices and I loved it. It tasted fresh and delicious. I also ordered peach soft drink and it’s good. :thumbs_up_medium-light_skin_tone:Ramen tasted normal only for me. Not extraordinary. However I’m happy with the experience.
Sanpoutei,"Tried their signature Rich Dried Sardine TSUKEMEN and it's surprisingly good. The noodle texture is springy and the portion is quite big. The sardine dipping sauce is very creamy and strong in flavour. Not to forget their Japanese Soft Boiled Egg (Hanjuku Tamago) is cooked to perfection, the white is cooked and the yolk is firm, creamy and it melts. Service is professional and the atmosphere is very soothing and classy."
Sanpoutei,Love the ramen noodle - not too starchy and just the right spring. Am not so keen on their mackerel soup stock .. that’s just me. The char siew melts in your mouth without the overwhelming greasy taste. Beware of the long Q - we were there on the dot at their opening time on a weekend and there were already a line!
Sanpoutei,"Although I think the orchard outlet has a slight edge on this one by putting everything together just that little bit better, it’s still a really good ramen restaurant in my opinion. Good texture on the noodles, broth that you can drink without feeling surfeit. This brand is probably one of those safe choices when you don’t want to be disappointed."
Sanpoutei,"Touted as one of the better tsukemen in SG. To best enjoy tsukemen, have to eat fast, dipping the cold ramen into a very hot portion of broth before that turns cold. The broth here is served really hot. The standard portion of ramen is 1.5 times for the tsukemen, I am a small eater and would have liked the option of a smaller portion of ramen. I love takenoko and will always an add portion, the ones here seems to be braised a little longer and are softer."
Sanpoutei,"Tsukemen - 4.5 stars I've never had this before and thoroughly enjoyed it, though my husband has had tsukemen elsewhere and says this one's solid. Good rich sardine broth with fish chunks, and you get a whole egg and bamboo shoots. Noodles are good but nothing special.  Oden - 4.5 stars Loved this as an extra source of protein. The mochi was delicious too."
Sanpoutei,"Food is not bad. Apparently, hailing from Niigata where they are well known for rice and naturally sake. Anyway, food is decent and I am not aware of good ramen places in West of Singapore. So it's a decent ramen fox for me living near beauty world."
Sanpoutei,"their dry ramen with sardine dipping sauce is SUPER good as all the flavours complement each other SO WELL. the prawn side dish was also AMAZING!! the sauce went so well with the tempura prawn & surprisingly their tempura avocado that came with the dish was good as well. 100% recommend both dishes.  their karage in tartar sauce did not disappoint & even the staple miso ramen here was flavourful.  the only dish i would not recommend is the cucumber side dish :grimacing_face::grimacing_face:. for 6-8$, u can make this at home. it was just plain cucumber with a drop of a spicy sauce resembling gochujang? the cucumbers weren’t coated in seasoning."
Muchachos,"Great Mexican flavours in Downtown Singapore.  Tried tortilla chips and tacos. Got the soft one, not sure if hard tacos is available. The vegetarian option has only two possibilities: pepper, onions and tofu. Prefer to have more options. But the food was really good"
Muchachos,This Mexican food served in this restaurant is really sumptuous. We three had different meals and they were so good. I loved my fish burrito. My son had a beer and it was at 50% discount. Wow! What a treat. You must visit this place!
Muchachos,"Probably one of the best casual Mexican food joints in Singapore. Really up there on top of my list. The place is small and could be crowded during peak hours, but the location is not near public transpo - so it’s not that packed quite often.  The food is top notch; I especially recommend their burritos and buffalo wings. One thing to take note of is that they offer a unique selection of beverages which are quite good, so if you’re not adventurous and the type that sticks with the usual soda maybe you should bring yours.  We tend to always overindulge at this place, but on an average it’ll cost you around $15-20 per person at Muchachos."
Muchachos,"Heavily packed during weekday lunches. What can I say? The burritos are so good, not overly burnt, finely chopped, well-balanced meal.  They do appear understaffed though. Invest in a queueing system."
Muchachos,"we got the $3 taco Tuesday’s which was honestly such a steal, otherwise their regular price is a little steep. very heavy on cilantro and raw onion flavour, may be acquired taste for some. tried the steak and fish flavours, they were ok, good bite and steak wasn’t tough"
Super Loco,Likely place for a nice dinner and chill out with friends. Like their chicken quesadillas when it’s served hot and it is little spicy. Lamb tacos was interesting and nice too but I would rank it second. The sizes are small and it’s just nice for a small eater like me. Would come again for another relaxing weekend
Super Loco,Third visit to this outlet. Was going to review earlier but didn't have the opportunity as the food will disappear before I get a chance to snap photos. Food is of great variety with gluten free and vegetarian options available. Location is brilliant located next to the river with ample indoor and outdoor seating. All the staff are friendly and accommodating. Special shoutout to Billy (hope I remembered the name correctly) and George. Keep up the good work. Will definitely be back.
Super Loco,This was a tasty modern Mexican restaurant. They had a few recipes that seemed pretty authentic. I recommend their elotes for appetizers. I tried their chicken for two and it was tasty. Decent sized seating right off the river. The staff was great and made good selections for us. They have a nice drink menu. There were a good amount of vegetarian and gf options.
Super Loco,"Delicious, modern Mexican cuisine. Great menu with lots of meat and veg options as well as a decent kids menu. Favourite was the cauliflower dish as well as pumpkin tostadas. Service was a little non attentive but otherwise a great experience in a comfortable environment by the river."
Super Loco,"It’s been close to a decade since I’ve been here so came back to try the food again.  Rather limited options, you couldn’t order the other tacos unless u we’re gonna commit to eating the same type and eating only tacos ($48) so we ordered the fish taco and the quesadilla along with the street corn.  The quesadilla was interesting with potatoes and fried eggs on top of the bacon and guacamole.  The fish taco was good but tiny for $11. Street corn was okay but I thought it was tastier a decade ago as it made an impression then.  Couldn’t taste the alcohol in the sparkling sangria, more like diluted fruit juice so skip it and try something else"
Super Loco,"We got an outdoor seat beside the Bay Area with the backdrop Marina Bay Sands. The view was awesome, there were a lot of people gathering around the area just to take photos in the evening.  Everything we ordered tasted fantastic, and the plating was colourful. The service was warm, friendly and attentive. It rained halfway and Solihin quickly relocated us indoor, and offered to leave the door open so we can enjoy the view, until the rain got heavier.  Overall, it was a unique and warm five star experience!"
Super Loco,A bright sunny spot for Mexican food. Pick an indoor seat if you want to avoid the mid-day sun. It’s also nice to sit outdoors to look out the waters on a breezy cooler day.  The food was very flavourful and colourful. Good spot for a casual lunch with friends and you can walk off lunch by walking along the quay.  The restaurant gets a bit noisy at times because it’s an open kitchen and some seats are right against their prep stations. Service could be a bit more attentive. It’s still a good idea to make a reservation ahead of time especially for outdoor tables in the evening.
Super Loco,"Just had a wonderful experience at this restaurant while treating my friend who's visiting Singapore. Although we were seated inside and missed the beautiful Marina Bay view, it didn't dampen our spirits. The food and service were fantastic, and my friend left happy and satisfied. A special shoutout to Elyn, our server, who was incredibly attentive and helpful throughout our entire meal. The baja fish and wagyu tacos, chicken quesadillas, and king prawn were all absolutely yummy. And the margarita was the perfect finishing touch to a great dining experience! Highly recommend this place for excellent food and service! :taco::tropical_drink::smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes:"
Super Loco,"Came here for their lunch set and left with a very full and happy belly! Everyone enjoyed the food thoroughly with no complaints. What’s there to complain honestly, with good food and an even better view of the MBS."
Super Loco,"Affordably priced, food was great! Loved the chicken quesadilla and the lava cake! Not forgetting the service was awesome! Especially by one of your staff who took our order (Malay guy) can’t remember how to spell his name, so sorry! But I think it starts with A. :grinning_face_with_sweat: (Thank you so much for the great service throughout despite being busy)  Will be back next time!"
Guzman Y Gomez,Mexican…so if you love the food try it. The service was fast and the staff was also good understood the need that we need a vegetarian burrito bowl. It was ready in 10 minutes and yum. The staff was really polite and helped in ordering. We tried the flavoured Mexican soda as well and like the taste.
Guzman Y Gomez,Food is always good. Service was excellent. Staff are so friendly! Love it.
Guzman Y Gomez,"I used to live in Australia and this branch has exact quality and taste as it was in Aussie. Staff is nice, service is fast. And food serving is so tidy and appetizing."
Guzman Y Gomez,I eat here three times a week and the food quality is ALWAYS good and the service is ALWAYS efficient regardless of how busy they are. Packed restaurant and food came in less than 5 minutes.
Guzman Y Gomez,"My second try at this branch. The service crew is very friendly, helpful and gave affirmation on choice of food chosen. I had mini pulled pork Enchilada. The portion is just right for me and I can’t imagine the size of regular meal.  Pulled pork is tasty and soft. I don’t really need to chew to much on it. I will come to try other item the next round."
Guzman Y Gomez,"Service was good, place looks clean and food was tasty too. Loved the fries, they were crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. Burrito had good flavors too, but the only thing was the rice and beans inside were cold (not even room temp). I wonder if that’s normal, cuz I don’t take burritoes often. :grinning_face_with_sweat:"
Guzman Y Gomez,"Love that the service is great, food always comes super fast and you can grab something healthy (brown rice) with beans (protein) here! Love the fries too! Always super piping hot and crunchy. Nice."
Guzman Y Gomez,Convenient place to eat a quick but nice lunch but music is a bit loud so the store is always really noisy. Service is sometimes inconsistent (sometimes the burrito comes with a small plate sometimes it doesn’t. Sometimes no napkins) but food is good and staff are friendly and usually quite helpful.  Reducing the rating to two stars. It’s not the first time I received a wrong order or had to wait 15-20mins during non peak hours. They have so many employees but not sure why they regularly make mistakes. Clearly something wrong with the workflow which screams bad management rather than bad staff.
Guzman Y Gomez,This amazing restaurant has a great selection of food which is suitable for both vegetarians and non vegetarians. It has excellent and delicious food. I often visit this place for lunch. It is quite affordable without any compromise on food quality with a good atmosphere to support the meal
Guzman Y Gomez,"I have no idea what SOP you guys have in place (according to the staff as an excuse). Ordered tacos with grilled steak a few times at nex outlet. I am totally disappointed by the amount of meat given this time round. I had a hard time trying to find the steak, which was buried deep enough with a super pathetic amount. Worst experience ever."
Guzman Y Gomez,"I missed eating Mexican food hence decided to give this place a try. You can dine in or take out. They serve finger food style of Mexican food. If you order the triple taco, you get to choose between different types of protein, mix and match. Their service was fast and good too. If you are looking for a quick Mexican bite, here is the place."
Guzman Y Gomez,Nice cute kiosk in the mall. They have few seating in front and back. Good selection of Mexican food but it more like a food court experience. Very basic interior. Good option to stop buy and pick a meal. I ordered mini burrito meal which was served with 3 nachos. I wish they could have given that more.
Guzman Y Gomez,"Huge fan of G&G but a little disappointed with service at this outlet. Ordered the mini chicken bowl set with fries and a drink, which was good. Asked for ketchup for the fries as I was waiting for my order and they said they didn’t have any and motioned at the salsa sauces. Really ? Sorry I’m used to having ketchup with fries not salsa sauce (which is meant for tacos/bowls)…"
Guzman Y Gomez,"Attracted by the positive reviews, we've opted for it for lunch. Reduced menu offer but food Tryed had good taste. Very small place, maybe Too small. We've we've faced Difficulties in finding a seat. Kind staff Good but Not so special as expected!"
Guzman Y Gomez,"Food was very dry, and the staff gave us the wrong order. Ordered pulled pork but was served grilled chicken. No complimentary sauce was given with our fries, and they wanted to charge extra 50c for sauces. Used to taste much better but not anymore! :("
Guzman Y Gomez,"I liked the food, but my enchilada was basically a burrito. Great taste though."
Guzman Y Gomez,"Went there yesterday and I have never felt more welcomed to a store I wanted to get takeaways from. The staffs there were friendly, helpful and just so joyful. It seems they really enjoy working there and I feel happy just from their vibe. Enjoyed my food as well. Great job service team :)"
Guzman Y Gomez,Mini burrito set damn worth! Their fries just amazing ! Best I had so far!
Guzman Y Gomez,"Finally open, this place has brought the GYG goodness to underneath Raffles Place. The best part is they've made sure there's lots of seating and I now don't have to travel as far for my burrito!"
Guzman Y Gomez,"GYG is consistently good. You can go with the burrito, bowls or the salad (for those looking for carb free options). The sauces make the food even better !"
Guzman Y Gomez,"Food is good, decent, satisfying and delicious. Some things I would recommend to eat and I would always go back for!  Drinks are fine. Had an Iced Latte but I’ll let it go for the rest of the drinks, because GYG isn’t quite a coffee maker so I’m not sure how to make it taste better.  Had the: Slow cooked beef Burrito Bowl Which was good! With rice, cheese loaded on top melting oozy and yellowing the bottom of the bowl with some salt and fat, and then a little bit of salt and tender, roasted, pulled beef streaks under a bed of fluffy warm rice. For fibre, expect mushy and soft black beans, round and thick and then covered with fluffy white rice.  Grilled chicken tacos Soft - Flour (Skin) It is delicious and has a great texture and combination of flavour, protein and texture. Think chunky yet chewy and delicious chicken cubes, shreds off diced lettuce leaves for some crunch, and cheese melt with some tomatoes.  Nachos and Guacamole small Perhaps the best thing to do is to add a little bit of salt and guacamole to the nachos and add some excitement and anticipation and nachos to taste and it will be delicious!  Pulled pork The only thing I would like to not repeatedly order soon.  Iced Latte Oh, and the iced latte! Ha. Might be worth checking out the store next door for some good iced coffee.  8/10 One of the most convenient and reliable and popular ways to get your cravings satisfied."
Guzman Y Gomez,"The hard shell tacos are the best!! The fries are very delicious too. The portion for the tacos are small but the rest are just nice. The spicy version isnt too spicy which I really appreciate. Since it's father's day, we got a free drink. Yay!"
Guzman Y Gomez,"Great fresh food  and polite staff , coupled with a great ambience , this makes it a place I would love to come often."
Guzman Y Gomez,"We came around 11am and it wasn’t very busy. Ordered a burrito bowl with mild pulled pork, quite filling. My boyfriend ordered mini nachos and a taco. I liked the guacamole :avocado:"
Guzman Y Gomez,"The counter staff was quite new thus a lot of things he is unsure along with us also totally 1st time trying out their menu, we were also totally clueless about how things work :grinning_face_with_sweat: Managed to order 2 sets or hard tacos to try with fries set and drinks. Pico was totally finished thus kitchen staff mentioned a change to guacamole which we are fine with. The hard tacos were fantastic! Really nice crunch to it. Tried the one steak and one braised beef, the latter one was much better and juicy. The steak taco tasted kinda dry. Saw online that there is free dressing sauce but not sure how to go about it. Just wished there was more fillings in the tacos, 2 pieces definitely did not satisfy the hunger :grinning_face_with_sweat: The fries came later which was freshly fried with cajun seasoning was a good add on, the 50cents chipotle mayo was kinda little for dipping though. Jarito guava was unique and refreshing, corona and sapporo were the draft beers available and i went ahead with the corona as it was just $5. Good mixture with the jarito as cocktail :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes: Will be back for more when craving hits :thumbs_up_light_skin_tone:"
Guzman Y Gomez,"Had a breakfast here. Try their burritos bowl tacos, and burrito. Had Jarritos as drink too, it was very refreshing. All was very nice and fulfilling, great Mexican Restaurant :TOP_arrow::OK_hand_light_skin_tone:  All the staffs were also very friendly and helpful. Will definitely come back for another visit when staying near Funan."
Guzman Y Gomez,"Guzman Y Gomez is my go-to food whenever I am in Funan. Love it! :red_heart: The staff are friendly and professional, and the food is fantastic. :face_savoring_food: My husband and I have this almost every Saturday. That’s how much we enjoy it. :smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes:"
Guzman Y Gomez,"we decided to stop by this funan outlet to finally try guzman y gomez! the staff were very nice and friendly when we were taking time to decide what we should get. we got the quesadilla, nachos and burrito bowl! the quesadilla was cooked nicely, with a beautiful char on the wrap. the nachos were perfectly crunchy, had a generous servings of guacamole and beans, and the chicken was cooked to perfection! the burrito bowl had the same serving of delish guacamole and beans, and the rice was nice. although some of the tables were slightly dirty, we would definitely recommend stopping by here for a quick mexican bite!"
Guzman Y Gomez,"Service was very slow. Burrito bowls, tacos, and the enchiladas were fine and tasted as good as the other branches. Hope that they can improve the kitchen process and not keep taking new orders when there are many waiting in the kitchen."
Guzman Y Gomez,"Came for the taco and stayed for the meal deal! I was craving a ground beef taco and saw the chicken mini bowl meal as great value. The taco hit the spot and the mini bowl was solid. Added sour cream to our order and it brought me back to my days of enjoying Chipotle in the US. Also, I really enjoyed the fries which kept very well for delivery. I’ll surely be ordering GYG again soon!"
Guzman Y Gomez,"Nice clean restaurant and great food. Tried the $3 taco and it was amazing. The corn chip was crispy and well seasoned, the minced beef was so flavourful and the lettuce was fresh! Love it that the staffs were still friendly and welcoming despite being so busy with both the dine in orders and delivery orders. They work fast without compromising the service and this is impressive!"
Guzman Y Gomez,I have only ever tried burritos and they tasted pretty nice though on the saltier side. The slow roasted beefs were really awesome and yummy though! And the fries were good too!
Guzman Y Gomez,"I ordered a fish burrito bowl takeaway. When I got home I realised it’s a beef bowl and I do not eat beef. Worst mistake the staff could ever make. Have to throw away the food, and how can I get my money back? My order number was 245 for today 19 Oct."
Guzman Y Gomez,"If u want a quick bite before hitting e pubs for drinks, come here for e tacos. Quite a lot of fillings to choose from including e wrap. Soft or crispy. Taste is ok. I ordered 2 tacos with a drink. Just enough for me."
Guzman Y Gomez,"Guzman y Gomez is a Mexican fast-food chain that offers a range of traditional Mexican dishes. Their menu includes tacos, burritos, nachos, quesadillas, and salads, with a choice of fillings such as chicken, beef, pork, and vegetarian options. I just loved the vegetarian food here that I tried and especially the quesadillas. You must try it!"
Guzman Y Gomez,It's a Mexican style food chain. I tried vegetarian food and liked them. Value for money. Definitely can visit next time.
Guzman Y Gomez,love the food and atmosphere here! VISH also recommended us the meat selection. the slow roasted beef is good! perfect! he even gave us free nacho chips as a complimentary! what a nice dude!
Guzman Y Gomez,"This place is full of great food(s). Never let me down with their promptness, delivery, service and taste.  You name a dish and taste is guaranteed. One of the finest place to get Mexican goods. Have been regular here and can’t discount their juicy grilled chicken stuff In quesadillas, tacos, burritos., etc"
Guzman Y Gomez,Place is good and not crowded even the space is not that big. Food is amazing! Awesome crew!. Special shout-out to Vish for being attentive to customer’s needs.
Guzman Y Gomez,Some dishes are nice but some are just sad. You cannot just dump salsa on a burrito and call it enchilada. Would only come here for nachos and taco. The rest don't bother
Guzman Y Gomez,"Enjoyed their burrito bowl with grilled chicken. :face_savoring_food: Portion is quite big for regular size. Might go for a mini next time if I want to order a set meal. Fries were served hot. :thumbs_up: Will try out their tacos, churros and  other stuff on the menu next time! :victory_hand: *Note: just scan the QR code on the table to order and you will be served. :thumbs_up:"
Guzman Y Gomez,"First time trying out your location, I was very impressed with the cashier (Chinese guy) during the afternoon for my lunch. He is very patient and does suggest things for me to try. Good Service, Good Food  Please convey and send my message to the staff and team inside the kitchen responsible for making my food delicious."
Guzman Y Gomez,"First time at this place.  Ambiance and comfort - 4/5 (most of the chairs don't have back rests, restaurant layout and design I'd say typical, with outdoor seating as well)  Service - 5/5 (friendly counter staff, I told him it's our first time here so he guided us how/what to order, served our food efficiently,  gave my girls free stickers too)  Price - 5/5 (I'd say value for money, I spent $52 for a meal for 3pax, which includes 3 regular set meals plus another 2 sets of churros with dips)  Food - 5/5 (we ordered *Cali Burrito with slow roasted beef, *3 Soft Flour Tortilla Tacos with grilled chicken, *Burrito Bowl with pan seared barramundi, the fish is overcooked in my humble opinion - it was filling, I wasn't able to finish mine, next time we'll just order their mini set meals, instead of regular sets, a set includes fries which are seasoned and crispy plus drinks, they also have a promo that gets you $1 churros set for every $25 spent)  Overall, my kids enjoyed their meals as well, they already have a plan to come back next month :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes:."
Guzman Y Gomez,The atmosphere is quite friendly. Good food and service. Staff are extremely knowledgeable and make great recommendations! :)
Guzman Y Gomez,I frequently drop by this outlet for coffee to-go (best deal in the whole mall!). Came in for breakfast today and had the loveliest service and delicious brekkie tacos/burrito with coffees. Not to forget crispy hash browns! Although we wouldn’t mind more value breakfast options that come on par with the $5 coffee and snack menu :grinning_face_with_big_eyes:  GYG WWP is consistent with their delivery and quality and we love it :)
Guzman Y Gomez,This is not the first time I requested a non given. My house doesn’t have any now due to renovation etc please do not impose your idea on others about recycling etc we all have own timing. Not everyone is good with eating with hands!! Respect each other our own way of eating be it with fork knife or spoon n with hands. !! So am I suppose to eat like this 4 legged friend?????? So now I have to use the container cover to scoop my rice. How pathetic now?? My unit in mess due to renovation. U just making me more miserable!!!
Guzman Y Gomez,"Great music, good food, pleasant service personnel. Food portions are good. Love love the nacho chips. Drinks are worth it during happy hours. Noticed that some of the patrons (30% of the crowd during a weekday evening 6-8pm) don't clear up the table after using it. Perhaps the patrons need visual reminders to be more civic minded?"
Guzman Y Gomez,"2 visits and standards were consistent.  Fast-food style mexican food for a relatively light meal or mid-meal option No hot plate fajitas but quite a few other options like quesadilla, burrito, burrito bowl, enchilada...  One can upgrade the mains to a meal with a drink and fries.  Get a corn chip with guacamole to add on to the mexican experience.. though corn chips would be better if crispy than on slightly hard side.  Add on a Churros with Duhe De Leche for dessert if one is still hungry ( taste like cinnamon flavoured youtiao )  Service was prompt and staff were friendly."
Guzman Y Gomez,The staff n server at star Vista is especially friendly and professional . Guided me patiently  on what is nice when taking order. They are generous on their cheese and condiments too! Tacos is tasty and fries is delicious! Very nice dining experience here.
Guzman Y Gomez,The food is tasty and served within 5-10 minutes of order. The atmosphere is relaxing and chill :smiling_face_with_sunglasses: Will come back again in the future with my friends :thumbs_up:
Guzman Y Gomez,"The food was delicious and fresh, with generous portions that left me feeling satisfied. I particularly enjoyed the burrito bowl, which was packed with flavor and had a great balance of rice, beans, meat, and toppings. The chips and guacamole were also a highlight - the chips were crispy and the guacamole was creamy and had just the right amount of spice. The staff were friendly and efficient, and the restaurant had a fun and vibrant atmosphere. I appreciated the focus on sustainability and using high-quality ingredients. Overall, I highly recommend Guzman Y Gomez for anyone looking for delicious, authentic Mexican food in a casual and welcoming environment!"""
Guzman Y Gomez,"I like the food here, while not the most authentic Mexican experience, it does give a tasty one. I usually go for (and recommend) the nachos with pulled pork or roasted beef."
Guzman Y Gomez,"Update, recent service was much faster, 5 stars! ----- Pretty tasty fast food - well, fast to eat, seemingly not fast to make. Expect to wait, despite there being a large number of cooks, buying a coffee here attracts a minimum 10 minute wait in my experience."
Guzman Y Gomez,"Yummy burrito bowl. I like to order the pulled pork burrito bowl. Portion was ok for the price. However, the quality seemed to be dropping. Sigh. Service was OK. Usually quite full during dinner time and had to wait for a while for the food and the seats."
Guzman Y Gomez,"Ample seating, great and freshly prepared food, fast and good service."
Guzman Y Gomez,Ordered grilled steak burrito bowl for $12.  Pro Steak. Tender and flavorful very tasty. Supporting cast of black bean and onion goes hand and with it.  Spicy and u can add in more sauce to make it spicier.  Meh Nacho I feel it is not crispy enough. Inconsistent saltiness  Rice is too sticky  Pricey.
Guzman Y Gomez,"First time trying out and it was good, the burrito bowl with steak was great with the tacos. The order and pay was fast and took less than 5 mins to serve. :thumbs_up:"
Guzman Y Gomez,"I’m glad that now they have both regular and small size for burrito bowl now. Small one is good enough for me. Ordered the additional $3 taco, which was quite flavourful as well. Friends had the quesadilla and soft taco. Loved their sauces. The jalapeños, chipotle and habanero all made the burrito bowl extra delicious. Oh if you like a healthier version, opt for the brown rice option instead. Whenever you want something healthy, cheap and quick, give Guzman a try."
Guzman Y Gomez,"This was my first time eating at Guzman y Gomez. I've never really had many experiences of eating Mexican food but the food served here was great and it was served quickly. I ordered the regular burrito bowl with extra cheese. It was great, but I just wished the cheese was a bit more melted. The nachos and the tacos were nice too! The thick cut fries go well with their sauces. Will come here again sometime!"
Guzman Y Gomez,"Great food. Great service. First time trying. Their $3 taco with just jack cheese, lettuce & mince beef w hard tacos is a great way to introduce to my 10 year old who is an extremely picky eater:grinning_squinting_face::folded_hands:"
Guzman Y Gomez,"Excellent service and very very lovable staff. They bring smiles to customer with their pleasant services and repeat order after customer place order, like best service! Please send good reviews for this outlet!"
Guzman Y Gomez,Food is always served fast and piping hot. Staff is friendly and helpful. Cosy dining atmosphere.
Guzman Y Gomez,Love the food! Come here almost every tuesday because of the delicious food and fast service. Their coffee with plant-based milk options are also very affordable priced from $2-$5.
Guzman Y Gomez,Fuss free ordering. Service is super prompt. Love the food as always!
Guzman Y Gomez,"The staff are very nice and well mannered, patient as well and my sister and I had a lovely time here. The food was delicious, will definitely come again :)  ps. Leave them a review on Google to get one free churros"
Guzman Y Gomez,"it was puzzling to find guzman y gomez on an industrial building, google address says it is on the 6th floor.. but the lobby directory dont show it. dont expect to have a restaurant! it is just a grab kitchen where you can have your food delivered. i posted pics you can refer to how to locate the grab kitchen. so order on grab app and pickup from this place or you can eat dine in your ordered food. there is NO physical GYG reataurant here. i hope it helps esp for first time user like myself."
Guzman Y Gomez,"Slight delay on the delivery however it was dinner time. So 30/40 mins was understandable.  Chicken burrito was amazing. Grilled chicken was juicy, generous amount of brown rice, Black beans and home made salsa. :red_heart::smiling_face_with_heart-eyes:  Churros with Dulce de Leche was perfect. Not too sweet but just nice. 2 piece of churros was also a balanced serving. Craving for more.  Sadly I wasn't able to finish the burrito unfortunately because I'm having covid. But once I'm fully recovered I'm coming back for more! :heart_suit:"
Guzman Y Gomez,"Handled by Grab, long waiting time, cost more than GYG outlets. Dining area full of mozzies. P.S. Wrong order packed too"
Guzman Y Gomez,"The food is great. But the waiting time is more than 30 mins. Hence, order early and collect."
Guzman Y Gomez,"food was perfect especially the churros. the food was still relatively hot when received, very fast service!"
Guzman Y Gomez,"Love coming here for my lunch. Always fresh ingredients, clean tables and smiling service staff. Today I was attended by Sara at the order station, she made my day. Overall a really great team. Happy to dine here anytime. :two_hearts:"
Guzman Y Gomez,"A godsend for me as it was still open at 8:30pm for dinner. Was hunting for dinner and couldn’t get anything - long Q or closing soon, so I was happy to see this still open and not crowded. Tables were filled but still some seats available. Saw the $9.90 set and tried to order on the QR scan menu but couldn’t. Had to approach the counter and found out it’s not on the app. Unfortunately, I lost my seat as I was alone and went to the counter to order. Luckily I managed to get another seat after ordering. The staff who took the order was helpful enough as I wasn’t so sure how to order. Glad that the set meal could allow other meats other than chicken with $1 top up. I had the slow roast beef. Not bad. But I found the rice was quite mushy. It could be fluffier. The spicy sauce is really quite spicy. I thought it would be like Nandos which extra spicy wasn’t really spicy to me. But Guzman’s spicy was fiery for me. The food was served hot and fresh, that’s good. Service was relatively fast enough. Good place to eat at for a quick meal in ion for reasonable price. Wouldn’t mind eating there again when I need a fast meal."
Guzman Y Gomez,"Ordered the mini burrito bowl set and burrito bowl beef. The set seems to be quite value as it came with a can of soft drink and fries. Grilled chicken was well seasoned and flavorful. Steak was soft but felt abit dry. The presentation of the bowl can be improved. Overall, the balance of the condiments and protein were good. Fries were crispy and well salted."
Guzman Y Gomez,"The service was unique and the food was delectable. Floors were cleaned and the in-house music gave me a modern fast food restaurant. Absolutely worth the money, however my taco went soft after I reach home. Hence, I suggest if u still want a hard taco when u reach home, try without the sauce and take one of the habanero salsa with it."
Guzman Y Gomez,Fast food in the most delicious and nutritious way. Love the nachos with spicy chicken. Not enough cheese though. Seats still available during lunch time.
Guzman Y Gomez,
Vatos Urban Tacos,"Good ambience, with attentive & polite staffs. We had a reservation at a Friday night, yet it’s isn’t too crowded. They offered complimentary nachos which tasted great.  The kimchi fries tasted good too as it’s filled with generous toppings. However, the tacos were bland and doesn’t tasted too cohesive together, which is such a shame. Frozen lime margarita is enough for 2, which is a huge plus point!  Overall it’s food it’s mediocre for its price-point."
Vatos Urban Tacos,"Really chill place to hangout and have a meal. Waitress came by my table at least 6 times to ask if we needed anything else. That’s rare by Spore standard.  Food was amazing! The chips are fried fresh and the serving sizing is huge! Go for the Taco, Burrito and Quesadillas! A+++++ Well done and deserve my 5 stars rating, we will be back!"
Vatos Urban Tacos,"We had an unplanned lunch at this restaurant as there was a bad jam at the area where we planned to have our lunch.  Good place for Mexican food :thumbs_up_light_skin_tone: The dips were delicious, food was fresh and full of flavour. The atmosphere was cozy with upbeat music (it may be loud and dim for some people but we liked it). The staff were attentive, fast and friendly. We ordered the following, total cost was about $125.  Carne Asada Steak Quesadillas Chili Lime Prawn Tacos Surf ‘N Turf Burrito Bowl 2 draft beers"
Vatos Urban Tacos,"Really just average. It's not bad at all but it's also not super delicious. It's OK. The presentation of the food looks really appetising. But once you take a bite or two, something feels underwhelming. Like the taste doesn't match the food. The free appetiser chips was a nice touch but the plate served to us was a little stale, like it's left out in the open since morning :')  Had the prawn quesadilla, one of the side pieces I took had no prawn. It's cheesy yes but zero prawn. The fries was good when it's hot and portion was generous but the flavour of the pulled pork was a little flat. The taco was not memorable at all. Again, very generous with the portion and a messy eat (no complains) but rather unexciting flavour wise.  The best item was probably the vodka wings. No taste of vodka but the sauce was very flavourful, savoury, coated well and juicy."
Vatos Urban Tacos,"Man, this place is old-school! Only a single vegan option as if the world isn’t burning :hot_face: Appropriately, my phone decided to take the worst photos of its life as if it’s still 2005 :old_man: Shame though because their one plant-based taco was actually good! As were their beers :raising_hands: Pretty good atmosphere and location too :round_pushpin: Just ping me when you decide to join the rest of us in the year 2023 :call_me_hand:"
Huevos,"Very nice and worth the price. I prefer the beef birria tacos to the fish but both was good. Dip the beef tacos in the sauce they give.. yummy!  The loaded nachos, the chips were very light and crispy. I wish there was could salsa and toppings, and also options to choose choice of protein as for this it’s only chicken."
Huevos,"Best Mexican I've had in Singapore (but the bar is low).  Expect a wait if you go during peak hours but they seemed to turn over tables relatively quickly. Food is not too expensive and portion sizes are big.  The pork Al pastor burrito is the best. Loaded nachos also good, and had flavorful guacamole. Fish tacos are fried nicely. The churros are BOMB and not too sweet"
Huevos,Very nice Mexican food! Just that the place is kinda tiny so you should reserve or go early to queue. Definitely recommend the fish tacos and loaded nachos. Maybe the only complaint is the slow service for how small the place is. Food takes a while even if you're first into the shop. Kitchen staff must be swamed  Overall a great place and im already planning to go back again.
Huevos,"Highly recommend the nachos. Fish tacos were generous. The beef tacos were decent too. Customer service is excellent. Quesadillas were okay, not a favourite. come early because queue is crazy"
Huevos,"This place is absolutely 5 stars and currently the best Mex in sg ! Sometimes there is a queue outside but it moves very quickly . I strongly recommend the fish tacos , the corn , lamb taco and cerviche. Love the hot sauce too :fire:"
Chimichangas,"Above average food. We tried the beef taco, fish taco and the chicken quesadilla. Of the three, fish taco is perhaps the best choice. Drinks were generally better than the food, had both the margarita and the frozen one. Will I be back? Probably, not that many fantastic Mexican places in Singapore"
Chimichangas,Amazing food and great atmosphere. All the food we ordered is really good! Love the fish tacos and buffalo wings the most. The staff there are all friendly and fun to interact with! Thank you Razi and John for the drinks that kept on coming. My friends and I will totally be back again.
Chimichangas,"This place didn’t disappoint! The fish tacos were bomb!!! Super crispy and fresh. Each taco set me back by $10, but I guess I’m gradually resigning myself to the fact that tacos are exorbitant in Singapore…) looking forward to trying the carne asada bowl and tacos next time, plus more servings of fish tacos for sure, and maybe some cocktails to spice up a future evening :folded_hands_medium-light_skin_tone:"
Chimichangas,"The food tastes really good. Cravings satisfied. Food ordered: Chimichanga, nachos, burritos, soft tacos, mojito and churros. The service was excellent. In our one year stay in SG, all the restaurants we have visited. This is by far the best service we have had. The servers are very attentive and proactive. The place matches the vibe and the food."
Chimichangas,"A standout was their latest creation, the Ancho Beef Birriamen, a delightful fusion of Birria and Ramen. Birria, a slightly spicy, sweet, sour, and savory Mexican stew, a total comfort food with the additional of Ramen. The tender Ancho Beef, added a layer of indulgence that left me craving for more.  We also indulged in the mouthwatering Shredded Ancho Beef Chimichanga, The 200 Days Angus Ribeye, aged to perfection, revealed its succulent tenderness, and also the tantalizing Barracho Fish Taco.  To complement our food, we partook in their Strawberry Frozen Limemargarita and Summer Bliss cocktails, offering a refreshing respite."
Chimichangas,"As someone living in Holland Village, this place has become one of my absolute favorites to unwind! Ian, the boss, is incredibly friendly, and whenever I pass by and see him, I can't resist having a drink. And, of course, one drink always turns into more! :grinning_face: I must give a special shout-out to Rave too, who is so kind and sweet while serving my drinks. Honestly, I'm not sure where those negative reviews are coming from, but from my experience, it's definitely a must-visit spot in Holland Village. Thank you guys!"
Chimichangas,"good service from all the crews. boss also gave us free celebratory shots and all the food was great, huge portions too. will be back again :) i loved the chicken a lot! super tender and well seasoned!"
Chimichangas,"Amazing place with amazing hospitality. Love the staff. We were seated in a dirty table at first but after requesting the staff for a change we were shifted to a cleaner table. There was this wonderful waiter named ravena who really helped us. Food wise, it was incredibly delicious although on the pricey side. I really did enjoy the loaded nachos. It was crisp, chewy and drizzled with cheese. The burritos were delicious especially paired with the green and red sauce. The burger was also extremely flavourful and crispy. Overall, a good place to enjoy some mexican cuisine although a little bit pricey"
Chimichangas,Always a great time at chimichanga! The gentleman standing at the entrance is very welcoming (noticed this every time we dine there!) highly recommend the fish tacos and chimichanga :) beef nachos are tasty too. Just a great place to have a few drinks w ur galpals
Chimichangas,"Lets’s start with the pros, the tacos, chimichanga and omni fries you can definitely try them was good! But the burrito bowl and fish tacos is definitely a skip! The rice was tasteless and fish was so bland like those prepackaged ones!!!  Surprisingly for a Mexican place their food had no beans, jalapeno, sour cream? Things you would often see in a Mexican restaurant.  Were arrived, we had made a reservation!There was 5 of us we were directed to a small high table!! The table was so small there was barely enough space for just the drinks, it couldn’t fit the food that we even ordered! You can clearly see from the pics! Super crampy & squeezy! We keep getting bumped by the staffs as they walk past!  So we requested to have a table switch the “boss” was utterly rude and said “this was their biggest table in the restaurant” haha very funny. He asked if we wanted to switch to the table outside which was clearly even smaller! :unamused_face::unamused_face:  I mean you could simply say sorry its not available dont have to be so rude & sarcastic man! Giving out gangster vibes! What a turn off!  Behind me just 4 people he gives them the biggest table that have in their restaurant, for five of us this tiny small table? Come on lah!  Understand outdoor is mask off but when indoor dont you have to put on ur mask? Clearly not followed by the boss. :yawning_face:  Drinks were okay not as alcoholic more like some gassy soda! Can just skip and get a soda instead!  The selection here seem to be lesser than the one at little india maybe not sure! There was no happy hour and shots?! We asked the staff to check on the shots but he didn’t even got back to us oh well.  After eating we left came by the front of the store, the boss couldn’t even recognise his own customers! Haha! :yawning_face: He asked us “do you guys wanna come in?” We’re like “We just eaten and came from ur restaurant man?” Seriously lack of attention for details!  Lastly this place is good for small groups less than 5 definitely! Try at your own risk! :relieved_face::relieved_face:"
Chimichangas,Nice windy and cooling alfresco lunch even when the sun is out. Tasty food with generous portion and attentive service staff. The only complaint is the noisy planes that flies over us at intervals.
Chimichangas,"Best to visit them during the weekend lunch hour, as it is not crowded. The fish taco taste great, crispy hot fish and goes well with the Mexico spicy sauces. Can skip the tofu fries, I find the taste really odd."
Chimichangas,"Nice little Mexican restaurant at Paya Lebar Quarters with outdoor sitting. The place is airy, service is excellent and some of the food items are very good. I’m blown away by the Chipotle Beef Chimichanga and found it going very well their Donkey IPA.  Great place to visit with friends and family."
Chimichangas,"Excellent food. Chimichanga was really good, the fried tortilla was a great textural contrast great balance of flavours.  Papa's salad was a standout winner though. Deeply caramelized potato chunks with a slightly sour cream and sweet pickled onions. Side dish but would be back just for this."
Chimichangas,"Great food and service, especially by Randy. Fun day out for children with free face painting day.  Would definitely try their food again, aiming for the grilled Lamb racks. It looks so delicious when it was being served on the table nearby :face_savoring_food:"
+886 Bistro Taiwanese,"Visited on a Friday evening and it was relatively spacious and empty. The place is clean and well maintained, good aesthetics too. The price range is really reasonable and I’m surprised by the quality of the food. Will definitely recommend the popcorn chicken and sweet potato fries; very flavourful and soft. Will definitely recommend this place!"
+886 Bistro Taiwanese,came across this from ig/tiktok influencers so came down to try it.  overall felt that it was an average taiwan bistro.  everything was quite pricey. the portion for both braised pork and chicken rice were just too small. it’s comparable to the 50twd bowls in tw and it’s around $5.80 here before gst.  century egg was nth much but salty was the sauce. milk tea not nice as well and cost more than the average bbt shops in sg.  the only dish that’s wasn’t that bad was the fried chicken.  don’t really recommend for the food. staff was quite polite. only 1 server around on a wkday night. able to make reservation but it was quite empty.
+886 Bistro Taiwanese,"Had a chill afternoon here. Vibes were great, good food and they have ongoing beer promos as well. The prices are definitely affordable. The pork chop and bubble tea was delicious. We also tried the truffle scallion udon and it was a very light and easy to eat meal:) enjoyed ourselves, this place definitely deserves a try!"
+886 Bistro Taiwanese,"Braised pork (卤肉饭) was delicious. I'd recommend ordering with the quail eggs which is also a nice side dish to the rice. The pork wasn't too fatty but it's fatty enough to provide the soft chewy feeling when you eat it with rice. Gravy wasn't too salty.  We also ordered the fried pork chop ... But that was so-so to me. Maybe because personally I prefer to eat and chew on pork, instead of flour. No doubt the outer layer was crispy and well-seasoned, but the layer of pork slices are too thin for me ... I think the pork was just about 5mm thick? :face_with_tears_of_joy:  For the drinks, we ordered honey milk tea. Tastes not bad!"
+886 Bistro Taiwanese,"Ate the shredded chicken ($5.80). Overall the taste was great and rice seemed to be decent quality, though the portion size was a bit disappointing (as compared to other Taiwan food stores i’ve tried where it’s a bit more ex with a bigger portion size). The bowl was about palm size.  I would be back to try more side dishes beyond the main - it seemed p good and ratings here are high!"
Colony,5-star atmosphere. Food is good. Very nice varieties. The thing that a bit off is the bread section. The bread is not warm / hot. It's all cold. The taste of the food is okay. Pretty crowded tho in the weekend. Would definitely comeback here for the buffet lunch and dinner it all looks legit. Hope to try their dinner one day so far breakfast and lunch is satifying.
Colony,"Great buffet spread, highlight was the cold bar! Fresh seafood, filled up on the crab leg. Another must get is the grilled lobster. Good dessert selection too. Ambience is nice but a tad too dark. Price is reasonable for the spread, try calling to book if the website doesn’t have availability!"
Colony,"It was an exceptional experience. The variety of dishes was incredible, and the food was fresh and delicious. I loved the customization options and the high quality of the cuisine. The presentation of the food was beautiful, and the value for money was excellent. The dessert selection was impressive, and the service was attentive. The ambience was pleasant, and the buffet area was clean and hygienic. Overall, it was a memorable and highly recommended dining experience."
Colony,"The Colony has always been my favourite buffet whenever there's a special occasion to celebrate. The food is exquisite, the service is impeccable, and the ambiance is absolutely oppulent. The staff, especially Frecel and Tin has been very attentive to our needs from the get go. They really made us feel welcome and cared for. Their small touches to make our experience more memorable were highly appreciated. Simply, world class service that would resonate to the guests even after leaving the premises. I would definitely come back and recommend the colony to friends and family. Two thumbs up for a 5 star experience!"
Colony,"An exquisite brunch served by Colony on a Sunday. The brunch is by no means cheap, coming in at 178++ per adult. However, the quality of the brunch is one of the best in Singapore.  If you want to surprise you partner or have a celebratory event here, I would recommend the Sunday brunch for sure.  I won’t write a long review and let the pictures and videos do the talking. Overall, 5* experience, quality, variety and would recommend everyone to come check them out for a great brunch experience."
Colony,"It was a weekend night and we waited only about 8 minutes for our meal.  We had the Braised Beef Oxtail ($19.90).  The order came with about 4 pcs of oxtail and 2 ice cream scoop size of homemade mash.  You can opt for the baguette. Would have been a plus point if some vegetables like carrots and peas were offered. Overall the portion was too small for regular appetite and for the price.  For $3.00 more we got the Premium set of the Signature Chicken Rice ($10.90 ) which came with a  bowl of Hainanese Mixed Vegetables and a bowl of marrow soup. You can opt to have the regular Signature Chicken Rice for $7.90 without the mixed vegetables and soup. The chicken rice was very fragrant without being oily.The sauce that doused the chicken was too salty. The chilli sauce tasted raw and ordinary. What stood out for me was the bowl of  Hainanese Mixed Vegetables. The cabbage, celery and carrots were well stewed and every mouthful was flavourful. I could had bowls of it!  There is no service charge for dine in."
Colony,yummy local food! service was fast too! recommend their hainanese pork chop :)  check out my IG @fruitfondue for more food reviews :two_hearts:
Colony,"Always keen to try Hainanese food... The pork chop $13.90 was well executed- sauce was a tad sour but we like it. Worthwhile to add $3 to add mixed vegetables (generous with black fungus) and soup. Mutton stew $17.90 was a bit small portion, with 4 pieces of mutton only but very flavourful and not very salty, we finished the stew - more like soup and really liked the bamboo shoots."
Colony,"Tried the chicken baked rice and hainan pork ribs curry. Definitely recommend the curry with baguette. The baguette was surprisingly crisp and tasty, perfect with the curry. 1 star down cause the serving is small so it is a bit of an expensive meal!"
Colony,"Chicken rice premium set was average. Meat was not as tender as I would think. Accompanying dishes was average, don’t need to add to become a set. Braised ox tail was good. Highly recommended. Braised beef stew was average as well. The meat was abit tough."
Colony,"Colony clothings (Japan style clothing and retails) is currently having a collaboration with BEAMS Japan and retailing their merchandise (kinda like a Pop-up store) They range though not huge is plentiful; from Blazers, sweaters to shirts and shoes. They are updating with new stock every other week."
Colony,"A Professional, friendly and best select shop in Southeast Asia. I would say this is the ideal shop for jet setters who love summer luxury resort style:)"
Colony,"Attended the Beams luggage show @ Colony Clothing and got a pair of Fortela chinos/trousers at 50% off! Even so, their prices w/o discount are extremely competitive especially for MIJ items.  Their lines always put Singapore's hot and humid climate at the forefront. Therefore expect to find lots of fabrics that are lightweight and possesses good ventilation. Now that's smart!!"
Colony,Great curation of products and a taste of beams in Singapore. However I've always found service lackluster and frosty.
Colony,Great choice of European and Japanese menswear. They also design many items in-house. Well worth a visit if like me you struggle with Asian sizing.
Colony,"Solid bakery, best place for birthday cakes! The Salted Coconut Gula Melaka and Mango Mousse are both heavenly!! Colony needs to upgrade their candles tho, the current ones are of low cheap quality. I had to get them elsewhere."
Colony,"We ordered a high tea, it was delivered on time and delicious.  The high tea had good combination of main items and pastries.  Well packed and presentable."
Colony,"Bakery at Ritz Carlton, with a delectable array of items. Was sold out by early evening, so looks like a mid-morning purchase only. Service was friendly (as you'd expect). Bought a ?fruited cinnamon bread - it looked gorgeous, but I guess my tastes lean more towards European style breads. Will drop by again to see what else is on offer, though."
Colony,I’d never expect a 5 star hotel to serve us plastic. Was enjoying their brioche bread until we bit in plastic. Bread was good but plastic wasn’t
Colony,"This is just located before the entrance to the restaurant at the lobby floor. I entered this bakery out of curiosity. And I was welcome by the store staff and ask if i need any assistance. I told her i am still waiting for someone and she ask me to please sit down. Very good service. As for the products, there is a wide choice of pastries. A good place to buy presents for family and  friends. There were some tables with high chair. This place have a good ambiance"
The Line,"We decided to come to the restaurant to have their lunch buffet to celebrate recovery from my injury on Thursday's afternoon.  We had dined at the restaurant a couple of times and always felt it is one of the best buffet restaurants in Singapore due to its buffet spread and good variety of dessert.  The buffet spread is pretty much the same with a good variety of cold and hot food, desserts, coffee, and tea. The lunch buffet was $68 before service charge and tax.  However, we did not find any wow factor compared to our previous visit. We are wondering if we expected more this time round or if the standard has dropped. There were prawn and crab but no oyster.  The good - cooked prawn, curry, rice, satay and dessert.  The not so good - The roast beef was tough. The sushi's rice was hard, and lack of  variety of steam food.  The service was average, unlike the service crew in a hotpot restaurant that we visited in the evening."
The Line,"Great range of food and tasty as well. I enjoyed the satay, duck, laksa etc. dessert was not bad as well. Although I think it has quite a bit of lamp dishes and maybe more beef is better- again this is personal. Why not 5 stars, I think the ice cream station can be improved. The chiller is not working well. Also, maybe having lobster will be good."
The Line,"Have been there many times for dinner (standard drops), but it is my first time trying their breakfast. For $43++ person, although the spread is good, the quality is just above average. One observation I had was the staff are no longer friendly. I observe the on 3 occasions where the staff get agitated when foreigner can’t understand them, and can be quite impatient to guests. I even caught a staff roll-eye at a guest. Some food stations staff putting on an unwelcoming face. If not my friends was staying there, and wanting to catch up over breakfast, I will not be there."
The Line,"I was here on last Saturday for a buffet lunch with my buddy. The buffet lunch was great, i love their snow crab. Will be back again for the variety of good food, good service and environment. Thumbs-up! Still feel The Line's buffet is the best!"
The Line,"Had dinner buffet on a Thursday night - The Line seafood theme buffet.  It was amazing! Seafood super fresh and high quality. The lobsters were fresh and quickly replenished. The baked oysters, black sauce fish were good too. Wide variety and excellent well done savoury dishes. Chinese, Indian, western, noodles bar, Japanese…. All good.  Desserts were fine and delicate - love the durian cakes, durian sago and chocolate fudge cakes. The ice cream were high quality type.  Service were great too.  Ambience also conducive for catch up with friends.  Will return for more. One of the best buffet."
The Line,"We are living here for more than 1 year. It's a very nice place to stay. Management and security personnel are cooperative and helpful. Currently, MRT construction is going on so there is a bit of noise and also, if you are living near the corner area, then you would hear traffic noises even at night.  I am not sure why Singapore govt do something with the noise pollution by cars and bikes. Singapore govt is taking a lot of mind-blowing initiatives but, however, not controlling the noise pollution. I hope soon they would take the necessary steps.  Overall, this condo is really nice. You will get swimming pools for children and adults, barbecue pits, Jacuzzi, a small gym which could be bigger one. Ideally it can have only 2 person at a time.  Security is really good over here! No one can enter to your floor without proper authentication as lifts work only with access keys. However, sometimes lift are slow."
The Line,Conveniently located next to future Katong Park MRT and short walk to East Coast Park. Easy access to downtown and CBD.
The Line,"Have stayed at Tower1 level 7 for over 1 year. Extremely Dusty (from all the construction sites nearby). Noisy (from both construction and traffic). Located in the middle of nowhere (no mall, no mrt).  Not recommended."
The Line,"Freehold next to U/C underground MRT station. Sleek twin towers, single loading designed units facing in North-South directions. Private, no crowds, bright and breezy from the sea. Some noises from MRT construction now but excellent for future."
The Line,Spacious and breezy. Worth a stay. But it is next to MRT construction site and its generate a lot dust everyday and rather not a ideal place to buy and last but not least the managing agent seem to be lack of resourcefulness.
The Line,"They are the contractor of my neighbour.i can understand the noise and dust during reno works. But a week ago, their workers left rubbish outside the doorway which is also outside my doorway. Our house is door facing door Last nightand now tonite,they left the door open throughoutthe night.  It was pitch black inside tat hse. And when my family members come home we see this dark scary house inside. Is there any reason why the door has to be open throughout the night? Or is the contractor is being inconsiderate?:enraged_face:"
Estate,"Service : Staff were friendly and attentive. Plates were cleared really quickly. When staff noticed we got some seafood, they brought over a finger bowl for us to wash our hands. They also brought over a piece of birthday cake for us which was a pleasant surprise!  Food : The seafood on ice was great. Prawns were fresh, oysters although on the smaller side were fresh and delicious. The truffle duck was really good and i highly recommend it. I do wish they would put more than 2 slices of duck on a plate since i had to keep going back for more and that creates a lot of plates for washing. The baked chicken with Dijon cream sauce was under cooked and pink on the inside so maybe cut into the chicken to check it before consuming. Desserts were really good and one of the better ones in Singapore. Highly recommend the chocolate mousse cake.  Price : it is one of the pricier buffets in Singapore, but i felt like it was worth it.  Ambience : It is a stylish place, the sofa seats were a little too low for the tables. The seats and buffet layout was a little confusing because of the different sections/arches/hallways but we figured it out eventually. The seafood on ice being away from the main buffet was a little weird but the staff explained to us where everything was when we were seated."
Estate,"Came for dinner - Lacking in cold seafood selection. Truffle duck, wagyu soup, beef Wellington, curry dishes and cup dessert (lemon meringue esp) stood out the most. cheese station doesn’t look as appetizing. No chocolate fondue too. Service was great though. Ambience quite relaxing too."
Estate,One of the best buffet that I have eaten so far... Great variety of food. Service was great as well as the clearing of plates were very prompt. Black truffle roast duck is a must try Seafood & Oysters were super fresh as well. We were given a slice of cake as it was our wedding anniversary
Estate,"An incredible dining experience at Estate! My husband and I went there last Thursday for the Lobster, Crab & Seafood buffet and it didn’t disappoint. Delicious food, beautifully prepared, and plentiful portions. Highly recommend trying these items: • Lobster bisque • Lobster Thermidore & Oysters • Hilton Black Truffle Duck • Wagyu Beef Noodle Soup  Top-notch service by the staff there. We enjoyed all the items except for the sushi which we feel is not up to standard. Appreciate the anniversary cake prepared for us towards the end of the meal:heart_suit:"

Estate,"Never return rental deposit Dear agents , Please help me with my deposit refund , KS Tan has vanished, such a disappointment from leasing differs from returning.

Estate,"Joining YES Group, these years I lower my cost of conducting my real estate business used the saving to reinvest in the business. :handshake:"
Estate,"As soon as there was some trouble with my owner, my agent stopped replying to my messages and was overall not doing much expect putting me on a whatsapp group with the owner's agent. Terrible experience."
Estate,Good ambiance Friendly people All are welcome
Estate,Deal with 1 of the salesperson was well trained
Estate,"Very unprofessional staff- Justin Tang & Joseph Kiong, who simply could not answer simple queries we had. And when he had an answer for a query, it was totally wrong.. Really run by a team of clowns"
Estate,"the CEA inspector keeps harassing us to face to face interview for a rental place we have shifted out long ago. she just keeps repeating herself in the phone that 'you have to meet me because it is required'. she sounded really slow and unprofessional, initially thought she's scam till we received their letter many months later. prior to that I already confirmed with her that we will not be involved for their case. seems like an informal council (?) that's govt funded and targets only individuals they want to? there are people who made reports and filed complaints but did not get resolved, but this tracking us down? furthermore, there were many more foreigner tenants before and during our time. they'll only do the easy job hunting down Singaporeans and forcing people to spend their time and resources without apology or thanks. echo other reviews here- worst agency in singapore."
Estate,"Limited seating, decor is industrial like. Staffs are young, vibrant,  diversified but not very attentive.  Food in general is ok. Only item I didn't like so far is the affogato. The cup they serve in is not suitable for this drink. Pistachio ice cream is yummy though."
Estate,"CEA, you need help, urgently and in many areas. First, the Sleaze doors - chief of these is this post-tenancy wrap-up by the Landlord's agent: ""I am acting for the landlord, anything you go through me (Landlord's agent)"". In short, no need for u (tenant) to have any contact info of your landlord.  I see a HIJACKER of a contractual relationship. This practice is ""KELONG"" and the motive of RING FENCING is SELF-SERVING"".  And it is almost always exerted by the Landlord's agent for repeat harvests ahead.  The fact is, once the tenancy is effected, the service of the agent or agents (where each contracting party engage an agent)  - end. This is unless the agent's service is extended in other legally recognised capacity or appointed and appropriately empowered, with stipulations as set out in the necessary documents.  Invariably, many woes result when the Landlord's agent is allowed to assume the role of his client, post-tenancy. It becomes even more woeful if the Tenant's agent equally thrust forward in the assumed position of his client.  This sleaze-door needs to shut and the sleaze, cleaned up. Stamp out the practice of Ring-Fencing and also make it obligatory that the Landlord's Agent disclose these: the email address(es), the correspondence address(es) and the mobile contact number(s) of the landlord(s). I trust CEA understands the rationale because you also ask the same set of information and more from parties communicating with you, don't you?"
Estate,"Called them every week for the complaint and then 3 months got the final reply. Very bad attitude, blind to the evidences. They are not helping individuals, contributes to the inequality of estate market."
Estate,
Estate,"I am a buyer of a unit which was sold by agent firhin yusoff. We granted 3 months extension and unit was finally handed over. Unit had lights removed and not replaced, keys were left in the riser, rubbish left in the unit and riser, window grille key not given. When agent contacted, he said he is not representing the sellers anymore and cannot do anything. Asked me to contact seller directly. Extremely irresponsible. Engage or deal with this agent at your own risk."
Estate,"Went to view, arrived at agreed appointment time, waited for the agent to advise, he texted 5 minutes but the agent didn't show up. Texted him but received no reply. Ended up waiting for over 30 minutes with no replies from the agent. Left the place without viewing. It's very unprofessional and disrespectful of people's time. We took the time to make our way to the place; I can understand people can be late but at least have the courtesy to inform."
Estate,"I recently engaged Mr Calvin See as my estate agent and I really wish to commend him on his professionalism and integrity. His wealth of experience had helped sell my place within a short 3 weeks and at a much better price than other counterparts. He acted always in my favour as his client, always did his best, super efficient in his marketing strategy and he was more a personable friend than an agent to me. I would highly recommend him to anyone who wishes to buy or sell his property."
Estate,"Excellent service by Kelly and Calvin. While waiting for my HLE approval, Kelly asked for my top three preferred areas as well as some important criteria I have. The flats she subsequently shortlisted showed that she genuinely listened. Calvin took over the house viewings and paperwork as Kelly went on maternity leave. I remember he would share his insights: how some layouts will be problematic and other factors to consider. Nevertheless, he wasn't pushy with his views; the choice was still left to me. I find their consideration of clients' preferences particularly refreshing. As for the purchase, I fell for the first house I viewed with SEA, and eventually bought it at lower than asking price, thanks to Calvin's negotiation. I am very much impressed that Kelly knew exactly what I wanted and more, and with Calvin's vast experience and skill. I strongly recommend engaging their services if you're searching for good and reliable realtors."
Estate,Very responsive and friendly! Manage to sold my house earlier than expected. Calvin also help me to get my new house that i wished for..Top floor with nice view..I've recommended my friends to look for him too..
Estate,"Julian is a very professional agent, and like to share his experience, and give you good advice to how to select your house."
Estate,Big thank you to Julian for helping us to sell our place! He was super professional from start to finish. We were particularly impressed by the detailed feedback shared after every viewing. There was transparency in the process and a lot of hard work was put in to ensure that our place was well presented . And the results showed! We managed to sell our place within two months at a price we were very happy with.
Estate,"Julian truly understands how to sell houses and are truly responsive to us. They made the process incredibly easy and their thorough knowledge, not only of general real estate, but of the local market and our surrounding neighbourhood amenities had made it a great pleasure throughout the whole process. We are extremely happy that our house sold having to meet beyond our expected selling price. Thank you"
Estate,"I would like to commend Julian for doing an excellent job in selling my property. He was instrumental in helping to sell my unit - working tirelessly behind the scenes to help market my unit effectively; from video production, photo shoot, social media marketing, listing and close of sale. Thank you!"
Estate,"We were fortunate to have Julian to help us sell our place in just 3 weekends of viewing. He was extremely helpful, responsive, responsible, and reliable throughout the whole selling process. Thank you"
Estate,"Sumitro is an excellent and trustworthy agent. He is very responsive and takes great care and thoughts into the sale of my unit. His experience in this line showed through his attentions to details and timely advice, yet he was never pushy but always patient and accommodating to your needs. I would recommend everyone to engage his service."
Estate,"Sumitro sold and bought our houses like his own. We are extremely grateful for the exceptional work of Sumitro from Pinnacle Estate Agency in helping us sell and then buy our new property. Not only did he demonstrated extensive knowledge of the market, he also showed great deal of attention to details, professionalism and patience throughout the entire process. We were able to sell our property for a price that exceeded my expectations, thanks to his strategic marketing and negotiating skills. Sumitro was always available to answer any questions we have and kept us informed at every steps of the way. I highly recommend him to anyone. We can never thank him enough for being such an instrumental agent.  Side note: he was from NUS Real Estate and he definitely was a student who listened during classes. His thoughts are always two/three steps ahead."
Estate,"Sumitro has been my housing agent for more than 3.5 years. I greatly appreciate his professionalism, attention to details, thoroughness in his service support. He is very responsive and effective in looking for prospective tenants, seeing to the fol0-on matters and handles each viewing with close attention, keeping me duely updated and seeking clarification where necessary, to achieve our aim of looking for the most appropriate tenant. I am most happy to engage his service."
Estate,"Working with Sumitro has been a memorable experience for us. We had very specific requirements when it came to getting a rental home: spacious home, quiet neighbourhood, close to Orchard and reasonable rent. That’s why it became hard for us to find anything on our own. That’s when we decided to consult Sumitro. To our surprise, he showed us a lot of gems. His understanding of Singapore neighbourhoods is amazing. Thanks to him, we found our dream home in Singapore. We’ve been living in this house happily for 9 years now. To make it even better, he managed to get us a good deal every time we renewed the lease. I would highly recommend Sumitro for renting or buying/selling of homes."
Estate,Sumitro helped me to rent and sell my commercial property all within 2 months at the price I wanted when others had the advantage several months ahead of him.   Must say quite an achievement from him in view of the fact that tenant and buyer profiles are entirely different.  He is very professional in his job without being pushy.  Always on time for his appointments and humble personality.  He gave us very good advice and we will not hesitate to engage his service again if ever needed again. Thank you...Sumitro.  From Mr & Mrs Albert Lee
Estate,"agents from this company are not responsive, msg was read, but never reply. poor quality."
Estate,
Sunday Folks,"I have been coming here for waffle ice cream ever since 6 years ago…? They’ve recently changed up their menu with seasonal flavours which I think is something to look forward to when I come back here once in awhile. No complaints at all with the food and service. I saw many others posted about the change in policy when dining in, but I think this is to make sure that the tables are fully utilised. Might be a put-off so management might want to consider some balance here."
Sunday Folks,Very cool cafe in Holland village. Really like the vibe. Ordered two waffles with ice cream and it was really good. I like the earl grey tea ice cream with the almond biscuit. Good job.
Sunday Folks,"Came on a Monday 8pm and crowd levels were low. Now they have a new rule where evey patron has to order an item, which I think it's fair if a group is gonna stay here for long.  Interior was nice and ice-cream flavours were light and satisfies my sweet tooth! Waffle wasn't really crispy anymore with the soft serve on the top. But batter was fragrant. The honey comb topping was really good and highly recommended! I rate: 4/5 :glowing_star:  Hot Chocolate and Ice Chocolate Affogato was quite mediocre.. would not recommend to drink expensive Milo and chocolate milk here. I rate: 1/5 :glowing_star:  Berry cake was light and fragrant. Has a good pudding texture too. Quite small though. I rate: 3.5/5 :glowing_star:"
Sunday Folks,Came here for quick dessert and ordered the white rabbit soft serve. Serving was very generous and it was delicious! I used to come here when I was young so it brought back many memories! Next time I will come back and have the soft serve with the waffles! We saw how the staff prepared everything and It was very organised and fun to watch! The smell of the waffles when you enter the shop is heavenly.
Sunday Folks,"𝙍𝙤𝙖𝙨𝙩𝙚𝙙 𝙥𝙞𝙨𝙩𝙖𝙘𝙝𝙞𝙤 𝙘𝙧𝙚𝙖𝙩𝙚 𝙮𝙤𝙪𝙧 𝙤𝙬𝙣 𝙬𝙖𝙛𝙛𝙡𝙚𝙨 ($13.50) - ice cream was very creamy and slightly sweet although the nutty pistachio flavour could be stronger. - loved the 𝙨𝙚𝙖 𝙨𝙖𝙡𝙩 𝙘𝙝𝙤𝙘𝙤𝙡𝙖𝙩𝙚 𝙝𝙤𝙣𝙚𝙮𝙘𝙤𝙢𝙗 most as it was crunchy which gave a textural contrast and complexity of flavour! - 𝙜𝙪𝙡𝙖 𝙢𝙚𝙡𝙖𝙠𝙖 𝙢𝙤𝙘𝙝𝙞 was soft and very chewy - 𝙗𝙧𝙤𝙬𝙣𝙞𝙚 𝙘𝙪𝙗𝙚𝙨 were moist and chocolatey :face_savoring_food: - waffle was a little crunchy on the outside with a soft fluffy inside, I liked how they added a biscuit in between the soft serve and waffle to prevent sogginess.  They have a variety of toppings which you can choose 3 from, other popular favourites are their caramel marshmallows and toasted almond thins!  Follow @iloafbready Instagram for more food reviews! :smiling_face_with_hearts:"
Sunday Folks,An aesthetically pleasing cafe. Each parfait is an edible art as they took time to prepare and the components are well thought of. The soft serve is refreshing and right level of sweetness. An ideal place to relax and enjoy a good dessert while soaking in the hustle and bustle of the shoppers right at the door step.
Sunday Folks,"A cozy ambience cafe that offers refined artisanal desserts and ice cream parfaits. There are a few tables nestled inside Bynd artisan store and everywhere looks so aesthetic. We particularly liked the parfaits as each ingredients are well thought. The price was a bit high comparing to its small portion, but the taste were aromatic and flavourful."
Sunday Folks,"Serving size of the Croffles leaves much to be desired. Earl Grey ice cream was too sweet, although the dark chocolate honeycomb bits were tasty. The fruit fizz drinks were refreshing.  All in all, an ok experience, though I think you can find better desserts at this price point."
Sunday Folks,Sunday Folks shares a shop with Bynd Artisan book binding shop. Walk further in for Sunday Folks to enjoy parfaits or cakes or hot coco or cafe. A cosy place to hang out in Ion Orchard. Nice and helpful service. Hot coco with two cubes of marshmallows! Tasted so good. But prepare to pay a little more than usual cafe. Do enjoy though!
Sunday Folks,"Dropped by the place on a weekend night without a reservation and had to wait 30 minutes to grab a table. Seating was limited since the cafe ùconsumed only half of the store while the remaining space operated a craftwork souvenir business. Food was obviously on the pricey side given the prime location. Nothing fancy about the pot of citrus tea I ordered but served beautifully in a tea set. Also ordered their ice cream cake, Pavlova which wasn't found on the menu. The waiter informed to wait for the hourglass to end to defrost the cake before indulging. I personally like the mango passionfruit ice cream but not its coconut crust base. Will be back to try out other desserts on the menu:)"
Sweet Cheeks,Their pistachio is seriously one of the best in Singapore. I am one of their recent regulars whom have purchased 8 to 10 pints of pistachio over my last 4 visits. My family loves it. The only reason why it did not hit 5 stars is because of the service. Some of their staffs just seem lost specially with their purchase card rewards. Maybe a little more training on customer service might suffice.
Sweet Cheeks,"Visited the outlet at around 8:30pm on a Friday night after having my dinner. Luckily it was a good timing because after we got our food, the crowd came in! We got waffle with Honey Chrysanthemum with Cacao Nibs and Marshmallow Oreo. The waffle and double scoop came up to a total of $17, which imo, seems like a acceptable price because their waffle had a perfect crispy golden-brown exterior and the inside was nice and soft. Their Honey Chrysanthemum with Cacao Nibs ice cream was a good amount of sweetness in contrast to the cacao nibs. Their Marshmallow Oreo was slightly sweeter and every bite had a decent amount of cookies and marshmallow, went perfectly well with the waffle too. Overall, a really good experience and will definitely come back again to try their other flavours!! :smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes:"
Sweet Cheeks,"The coffee is really bad, the coffee beans taste stale and bitter, I make a better latte at home. The waffles are also soggy and not crispy. The staff are a bunch of xmm and are constantly on their phones. The decor of the cafe is really cheap and makeshift. I don’t think they should be charging these prices for such quality and service"
Sweet Cheeks,"Sweets,desserts are always very much a personal preference. For me, it was underwhelming in terms of taste,tried the dark chocolate and chrysanthemum ice cream. The chrysanthemum ice cream reminded me very much of Yeo’s chrysanthemum drink. However, it’s a good place for big groups who wish to hangout late into the night."
Sweet Cheeks,"$18 for waffle + 2 premium scoops. Ice cream itself were ok. Sadly, waffle was burnt and tasted butter. It was also too airy for my liking.  I’d recommend the ice cream but not the waffle."
Sweet Cheeks,Nice gelato place for nice dessert and chill out! Good variety and ambience. For my sweet tooth and cheek! Lol
Sweet Cheeks,"Aesthetic and spacious place, visited on a Friday night and it was booming with people (but there’s lots of seating available). Tried the Dark Chocolate & Hojicha ice cream, great combination and not too sweet. Service was quick and efficient, but I’d like to comment that one of the crew was wearing a pair of inappropriate shorts. Will be good to review the attire of the staff."
Sweet Cheeks,Good affogato. Premium dark chocolate was good. Cold mocha was average. Nice ambient and cozy. Parking is limited and road side parallel lots.
Sweet Cheeks,"Waffles were really fluffy! Wide variety of flavours- Pistachio, strawberry, hazelnut and chocolate flavours of ice cream were :face_savoring_food:! Will come back for the waffles!  I really like how big the space is and we can just chill and enjoy the night there!"
Sweet Cheeks,"Rating: 5 / 5 stars :star-struck: : Range of flavours, ambience :sneezing_face: : A little cold  I have recently been trying to manage my expectations at ice cream/gelato spots, but this one blew it out of the water. Lots to choose from and the selection has a great balance between creative, modern takes, and classic favourites. I had the pistachio and honey chrysanthemum and I had them with waffles. Whilst I enjoyed them, i found that the honey chrysanthemum would probably better enjoyed on its own. Just before I left, I sampled the lemoncurd speculoos and found it to be outstanding - juts a tiny regret but then, that leaves me with a great reason to be back.  In general, the other flavours that I sampled - honey mascarpone, dark choc, biscoff cookie crunch, hojicha - were all great. It was frankly a very hard pick.  Ice cream aside, the cafe is really spacious and has room for at least 40-50 patrons. Toilets are clean. However, it can be a little too cold when the place is less crowded - no biggie though."
Apiary,"we decided to come here for a quick snack! we had their apiary, pistachio and coconut ice cream. all the ice creams were very creamy, and had a nice flavour. we also had their waffle, which was freshly made. it was also crispy on the outside and chewy and soft on the inside. their yuzu pear blossom tea was aromatic and piping hot. lastly, we had their brownie, which was a giant chunk, with a beautiful gooey center. the staff were very accommodating and friendly too. we would DEFINITELY encourage other ice cream lovers to come, and we will be coming back for MORE!"
Apiary,"Not sure if age is catching up on me (lol) but I found the ice cream to be very sweet, with the sweetness lingering on at the back of the mouth. Would have liked the unique flavour of the ice cream to be more pronounced instead. Tried the Dark Chocolate and found it to be more sweet than bitter too. Waffle was nice and crispy on the outside. Staff were amicable"
Apiary,"Great and quick service, super good ice-cream and waffle is awesome too. Place can get a little loud if it is crowded but that’s fine, doesn’t affect the taste. This is personal but I find the fork fits a little weird in the hand, like it kept wanting to rotate but that is fine as well! Would visit again for sure. Thank you!"
Apiary,"Having heard many good reviews, I was excited to try despite the 20 min wait, but it left us with disappointment :smiling_face_with_tear:  𝙒𝙖𝙛𝙛𝙡𝙚𝙨 ($8) - Made with brown butter which gave it a golden colour, I loved how crispy and airy it was with a sweet fragrance! - Thick and didn’t turn soggy at all. [8.5/10]  𝘿𝙤𝙪𝙗𝙡𝙚 𝙨𝙘𝙤𝙤𝙥𝙨 ($9) - 𝙎𝙞𝙘𝙞𝙡𝙞𝙖𝙣 𝙥𝙞𝙨𝙩𝙖𝙘𝙝𝙞𝙤 (𝙥𝙧𝙚𝙢𝙞𝙪𝙢 +$1): Could barely taste any hint of nuttiness and it was rather sweet though the texture was smooth and creamy. [2/10] - 𝘼𝙥𝙞𝙖𝙧𝙮: Honey ice cream with crunchy cocoa nibs had a light flavour profile and quite one-dimensional, a slight saltiness would probably combine well with the mellow sweetness. [4/10]  Perhaps their other popular flavours like ferrero rocher and blue pea would be better, but the waffle itself was amazing!! I wished they sell it on its own like neighbourhood bakeries :face_with_tongue:  Follow @iloafbready Instagram for more food reviews! :smiling_face:"
Apiary,really interesting flavours! got the blue milk scoop and it was really good. there was a small upstairs place for you to eat your ice cream which was nicely air-conditioned and had a small toilet. great place to stop by for a small dessert.
Apiary,Not a lot of seats but ice cream was great! My niece was enjoying the chocolate ice cream. Nice background for photo taking too. Hidden gem in AMK Central!!
Apiary,I went there with my sister for high-tea. They have very unique flavours of ice-cream and the waffles is very crispy. I love all of it.
Apiary,"Very happy to see Apiary in AMK, near MRT and bus interchange. Brown butter pecan flavor is super good."
Apiary,"Fancy ice cream. Tasted good, was expensive. No sampling. Nothing wrong neither outstanding about the brand/shop.  I wouldn't mind coming back If crave ice cream and I am nearby. Nothing that are must try"
Apiary,"There were few people on the queue when I passed by and I decided to try their ice cream. I was looking for chocolate and I took milk and chocolate which is on premium ice cream. I didn't really like it though. The ice cream was on soft type ice cream and more to milk rather than the chocolate, maybe the other choice was better.  There are few outdoor tables outside the store where people ordered and sat down there."
Apiary,A very popular well known ice cream joint that never fails to impress. Offered variety of ice cream and they are all delicious. They also sell in tubs. Limited seating avail. Pricing is friendly.
Apiary,"Nice texture. Some say the taste is subdued, but I actually like it. You don't feel sick of it after eating the whole thing. I can keep going!  Nice place to have a scoop of ice cream on a hot day. Simple and beautiful decor too."
Apiary,"Ice creams were really yummy, especially their Christmas Black Forest Special! We got the Caramelized Strawberry and 73% Dark Chocolate ice-creams too.  Not 5/5 as there's limited seating even though they had more than enough space for extra seating but they chose form over function.  Quite aesthetic ice cream cafe that's nice for a pit stop or dessert spot though! Will pop by again when they're not busy."
Apiary,"This place has great flavor profiles - flavorful but not too strong. We have not tried anything that we didn't like.  If you want the super strong taste, this might not be your cup of tie. But if you want a light, refreshing treat, this will be right up your alley."
Apiary,"Texture is good but the flavours are so mild and subdued?? I tried the earl grey and chocolate and safe to say neither flavours were anywhere close to the richness of other ice cream spots like creamier. The earl grey here tasted super bland and the chocolate was not bad but not excellent either. Was expecting much more in the quality here given the hype. Besides that, ambience is nice."
2am:dessertbar,"Satisfying desserts! I ordered two since I have a sweet tooth! Shades of green is creamy, sweet (just right) and woody. But the zesty is my favorite! Tangy lemony, sweet and salty with that kick of almond. Commending Leslie and the team for the top notch service even tho they were full. :clapping_hands::clapping_hands::clapping_hands: well done!"
2am:dessertbar,It was a lovely night out at 2am dessert bar! The desserts were crafted to perfection and was plated so precisely! The staff were extra warm and friendly! Shout out to Sue who gave us her recommendations and was just wonderful! Thank you!
2am:dessertbar,"A great place for dessert! Staff very friendly, and they also gave us recommendations for what to order. The ambience was also nice. Their toilet is also very clean and has Dyson hand dryer also :thumbs_up:"
2am:dessertbar,"2am dessert bar offers really creative and interesting selections of desserts, tea and cocktails! we chose the sticky date pudding and noted the sweetness of really fresh dates, which was a really refreshing palate. 10/10 for the amazing service! the ambiance is very different from the other bars in holland V, a hidden gem in the hustle and bustle."
2am:dessertbar,We've been here multiple times and it's always been a unique experience every time. A place for unconventional dessert flavors and pairings. Plus points for the welcoming staff
Around Café,"Chanced upon this outlet ""Around Cafe"" around the curve of Tampines Street 86 next to a condo selling waffles & ice-cream. We decided to give it a try. We ordered two sets with double scoop ice-cream. The waffles served are the bready kind and not crispy. Not sure if it their way/recipe that has this outcome but we'll it's our first time here so can't comment much till our 2nd time. They offer a nice selection of ice-cream. We tried the pistachio, dark chocolate, vanilla & cookies & cream. The ice-cream has great texture and tasted good. White coffee & hot chocolate drink is the same as anywhere else so can't comment much. Great ambience, price are slightly high but quite the same as anywhere else. Will come back again to try more of their ice-cream flavours and update on the waffles the next time."
Around Café,"Interesting cafe that can be found right next to a condo.  The waffles is something to die for! I had eaten many waffles at many ice cream cafes before and I had to say the waffles here is the best so far. You definitely won’t be able to resist it even if you are feeling very full from dinner. Hits the 5 senses, visuals, texture, smell, taste and the ambiance is great!  Definitely, need to try the pistachio ice cream and the hazelnut rocher is sinfully great. Worth the calories!  If you’re hungry, they do sell food as well and the chef is very experienced and had worked in the kitchen of well known restaurant before!  In conclusion, if you haven’t been to this glasshouse cafe, it’s time to go! If you had been there before, you would agree that it’s worth many more visits!"
Around Café,"Heard this cafe from our friends, our first time here, we had waffles with salted butter caramel & earl grey ice cream. Very nice ice cream favour, taste very natural and not very sweet, which suits our taste very much. Recommended!"
Around Café,Crispy and just right when bite yet still moist waffles paired with lovely and gelato like ice cream flavours! Pricing is also affordable and it is a nice go to place for dessert at night! Loving the cosy vibes too!  Ordered ice cream flavours: - Pistachio 10/10 - Açai yoghurt 9/10 - Strawberry Cheesecake 8.5/10 - Earl Grey 9/10  With two waffles!  Will come again to try other flavours too!
Around Café,This is by far the best waffle ice cream place we ever come across! Have been their regulars since we found out about this place.. nice ambience nice waffle nice staffs and they even made us our favourite hazelnut latte no doubt it's off the menu!!!! Fantastic isn't it!
Around Café,The Waffles and Ice Cream is really very good.  The other food I would say so-so and can be missed. So I'd only be back for Waffles.  The place is really noisy when running full house. We can't wait to leave right our meal. It's so stressful to eat in such noisy environment.  Cafe is on 2nd level. Not wheelchair friendly.
Around Café,Passed by this cafe and decided to give it a try. Food was not bad. Service was fast. It could be a bit noisy when you dine inside but there are some outdoor seats which are quite limited. We came late when they almost closed so couldn't try any desserts. Would be back to try the dessert next time if I'm around the area.
Around Café,"One of our favourite joints. The lamb shank just falls off the bone, I didn't even need to use my knife! We must have the emperor's fingers side every time. Wife got her usual salmon."
Around Café,Waffles was really good. Liked the truffle fries too. The mains were average. Total damage $83 for two.
Around Café,"Superfast mobile order. Ordered soup of the day, potato leek soup and mains mushroom truffle gratin. Yummy for both. Awesome hidden cafe. Quiet little hidden GEM :gem_stone: :sparkles: OF tPY."
Around Café,"Look at how pathetic the bread is. It’s as thin as some biscuit. Not sure why I paid $5.50 for this set. The tables are also way to close to each other. And the air conditioning wasn’t working, so it’s super hot and stuffy. Never coming back here."
Around Café,"The food and drinks here blew my mind. Was not expecting them to be this good. Ordered the earl grey milk toast, kaya toast set and laksa and we loved everything! Very generous portions and amazing flavours. Don’t sleep on this!"
Around Café,"Food is bad, except the eggs. The fishball soup was decent, at least the soup had flavour, but the fishballs were barely palatable. The earl grey milk toast set was disappointing. There's barely any taste to the earl grey milk spread. I almost had to imagine what the taste was like. Same with the earl grey milk tea, disappointing as well.  I don't know if it's a bad day or just the regular food they serve, but I wouldn't come back here. It's really too disappointing. Perhaps there's a queue because they're opened earlier and there's no other choice. I don't know, I'm feeling a second wave of disappointment just looking through the pictures again.  Not worth the money. One of the rare times I didn't finish my toast at all."
Around Café,"Had the peanut butter toast set with kopi o, great value for money! Eggs are interesting - one sunny yellow and one runny red."
Around Café,"As satisfying as I remembered. Thank you for the consistent simple pleasures of life. And priced at 1.80, it is certainly a good place to recommend fellow retirees."
Around Café,"There wasn't cold so I liked it. Best of all, the coffee's tasted so good!!! It wasn't sour and I loved that I could taste two different types of espresso. I think the price is reasonable, too."
Around Café,"Decent brunch place. I love that tax & GST r inclusive in the menu price  My go to is the chicken burger set. Really filling and tasty, esp the generous sweet potatoes  Croissant egg was decent. The croissant should be more chewy and buttery. The added chicken was very generous, but quite dry and boring  They will serve free water if u ask. In a small glass, but won't refill  The seats r limited. I always prefer coming in solo for some quiet brunch time"
Around Café,"First time here even though I have passed by many times but took shelter in the rain today and decided to have a go at the scones. 1. Orange scone served with butter and jam, returned jam as I do not like the sugar in jam. 2. Service crew offered me butter additionally which was nice. President butter is what I like. 3. Tea in a pot is good for 1. Tropical paradise which was what I ordered tasted nice. 4. Clean seats and table which were a plus point. 5. They have 2 types of scones which was what made me stay there for a break after early dinner. I should back next time."
Around Café,Sourdough with avocado and coffee were really good. Chocolate croissant not as great but not bad neither. Service staff was so friendly and welcoming. Place was clean and tidy. Not crowded during a Sunday afternoon which I like it too.
Around Café,Din know they have a branch in Lorong Chuan. Used to frequent the other outlet at Turf city. I feel that the coffee at turf city is better; whereas this outlet has a better ambience and quieter.  Oh did I mention that their truffle fries is good?
Around Café,"The texture of the waffles is perfect. Crunchy on the outside and moist inside. Taste wise, cutting back on the sugar just a little will be perfect. I like the cinnamon crumbles too"
Around Café,"Rainy day reminds me of ice cream and i made a trip to a nearby neighbourhood ice cream cafe.  I had done my research before heading down and was hoping to try waffle with 2 rounds - pistachio flavour and coffee flavour.  But i was disappointed that ""only ice cream was available"" and there were only 7 or 8 flavours to choose from.   I chose 2 - matcha and peanut butter.  Both were decent and i like peanut butter more.  But the feeling of being able to try the waffle still left me feeling disappointed.  Btw, understably, there is no sampling of flavours due to the pandemic."
Around Café,"Visited this cafe in the afternoon, pretty chill place to avoid the sun. Although there's limited selection of ice cream available, the quality of ice cream is far superior to other cafes in the vicinity. I would take quality over quantity anyday and frequent this cafe. There are power points to charge your electronic devices too.  Ice cream is the type that doesn't melt easily and flavours are rich. Overall a pleasant experience."
Around Café,Nice waffles thats crispy and lots of volume though marshmallows were kinda redundant. Small shop and hence limited seating.
Around Café,"I went there on a Sunday night and they had a very limited selection of ice cream. They were also out of waffles. However, what really turned me off was the service. The staff was rather unpleasant and unwelcoming. It created a very unfriendly atmosphere in the small space and did not make me feel like staying or dining in."
Ah Chew Desserts,"A touristy dessert place so there is always a long line waiting. However the queue moves fast, you can choose dishes while waiting. After being seated you have to go order at the counter. Mango sago is very satisfied, rich fresh mango flavor and not to sweet. Grass jelly drink is very refreshing for a hot day in Singapore. Banana split is nothing special, not recommend."
Ah Chew Desserts,"Visited on a Saturday night and it was crowded, but the staff were efficient and we quickly found a seat. There are two queues, one for seating and the other for ordering food. Menu contains a variety of dessert and we chose the yam paste and durian + ice cream. The taste was great but was slightly on the pricier side. The yam paste was thick and not too sweet, but portion abit little, durian was a little too sweet in my opinion. But definitely worth a visit for tourists, will come back again if I’m around the area next time!"
Ah Chew Desserts,"Their menu offers a wide variety of dessert options. We enjoyed the milk-based ones like the Steamed milk egg white and the hawaiian papaya boiled with fresh milk. The mochi rice ball was pretty good too. During my stay in Singapore, I visited this place on two consecutive days, and am looking forward to going back during my next trip. Price is reasonable too. But do expect a queue."
Ah Chew Desserts,"Ending off with a bowl of hot/cold desserts had become my essential. However, I am also very particular about the taste and quality. Maybe that’s because I know how to make the real stuff (but lazy) that is why I cannot compromise the standard.  I never had Ah Chew dessert before but I saw long Q amount the other 2 desert stall nearby therefore I Q..  We were lucky/unlucky to have a table very soon and happy that it’s in front of the serving counter (photo of open kitchen).  Firstly, when I wanted to  order my food, I was asked to follow the Q outside in a hostile voice from the cashier. It really turns me off.  Second, the way they scoop the dessert from the pot, they just drip all over the counter and it just look Soo messy and not appetising.  Thirdly, the taste.. It sooo diluted, starchy although it’s not too sweet. There is definitely no quality, all are just plenty of starch.  To me… it’s not worth the time to go and Q, no quality, lousy taste.  Disappointed :pensive_face:"
Ah Chew Desserts,"Few times here and first time after the global pandemic. Luckily for us , no queue at all and just walk in and sit. However , they still not allow to sit longer than 30 mins per table although no waiting line. Black sesame hot is my good choice today. :drooling_face:"
Ah Chew Desserts,"best dessert in orchard. a branch of the very popular bugis ah chew desserts.  newly opened, very clean place. best of all, no need to queue.  mango sago excellent. durian one is also very good.  came here twice during our visit to singapore. located in first floor cineleisure, one of the new tenants."
Ah Chew Desserts,No long Q and cramped seating like the original outlet. Can slowly enjoy dessert and no need to rush. Good resting place if tired of walking in orchard area
Ah Chew Desserts,"Finally they opened a branch here in Orchard Cineleisure which is much more convenient. We were lucky to not meet any queue on a Friday night, and managed to get a table within a few minutes in line.  True to recommendation from many, their desserts were good. At least to all four types (Mango Sago, Peanut Paste, Black Glutinous Rice With Vanilla Ice-Cream, Ginko Barley Beancurd Skin Soup) that we had ordered. Not too sweet and yet able to satisfy our sweet tooth.  Overall, they should have done better for their table placement especially when more than 4 persons are seated to a 4 paxs table and 5th or 6th or even 7th persons are seating out of the table and space… Its not really comfortable to share seating space with other patron from another table. Isnt dessert a comfort food and supposed to be enjoyed in Comfort?"
Ah Chew Desserts,"Cool and refreshing dessert, open till late so it’s just perfect after movie late at night. No queue at 11pm but still had to wait for the food. The mango sago is just ok, nothing special to me."
Ah Chew Desserts,"Very bad service. Was there with my friends last night and we ordered one dessert each of our own. While eating my friend just took out a small cake and shared with us to munch on.  One of the lady with short hair, named ah Kim from what I heard from the colleague, came and approach us and told us no outside food was allowed, which was understandable. But what made me angry was she added on a sentence “ I will throw it away “. She could have just told us nicely no outside food and the additional statement was not neccessary. We are very offended with that statement and we even said sorry. My friend told her that she shouldn’t be saying that in the future as it was rude. She got very aggressive said that all places are the same, we should know better. Is this the type of staff that you guys tolerate to be on the ground ? Sooner or later your customer will get chased away due to the bad service. Please conduct a proper training with your staff. First time here but encountered such a bad experience. Will definitely not come back again. All the best to your shop."
Kooks Creamery,"Chocolate lava cookie ice cream is awesome after a night run. Not too crowded the night I visited, so no queue and they served it pretty quick even though they prepared the cookie fresh - made to order.  Their chocolate, coconut and Thai milk tea ice cream will make you keep coming back for more. Order pints to go for the complete experience."
Kooks Creamery,"Had the chocolate lave waffle with ferror rocher icecream, waffle could be hotter and crispier. Also had the chocolate lava cookie with chocolate pb icecream, it was yummy but the cookie could be bigger for its price. Overall these 2 items cost me $27.10, abit pricey"
Kooks Creamery,"Would recommend sticking to just a single scoop, feels like it would have been the best ratio of ice cream to cookie!  Flavours were interesting, and they serve Kittea's tea there. Would have rated it 4.5/5 with a little dent because they don't do lava waffles anymore.."
Kooks Creamery,"Pretty decent ice cream but very nice chocolate cookies! The molten chocolate just pours out when they plop the ice cream on it.  They don't serve water and the place can get pretty crowded just after dinner as everyone goes for desserts. Also the shop is pretty small, 5 tables inside and 3 outside if I remember correctly."
Kooks Creamery,"You have no idea how upset I am with this, it was not worth my monthly quota of sweet desserts calories so I wasted it and I feel so angry + this was $12.80 I’m ok with eating food but if it tastes bad, was expensive & wasn’t even a treat - :pleading_face: it upsets me so much.  Immediately no. It tastes like any normal ordinary waffle and there was no “lava” in it at all. Even that Prima Deli waffles tastes better than this. :tired_face::loudly_crying_face: The waffles are so bland, they’re crispy. But bland- the chocolate is just there to mask the taste of the waffles.  They just topped it off with regular chocolate sauce and I have never been this disappointed before. Won’t come back again lol.  My friend says the cookie is good, to me, it’s just a regular undercooked cookie that has chocolate in it & its reheated again.  It’s really expensive and honestly not that fantastic. The girls who served us were sweet & friendly so I’ll give them plus points for that."
Kooks Creamery,"Visited the ice cream shop around 3-4pm. There was a little crowd, the ice cream smells good. Ordered the blue Hokkaido milk ice cream single scoop and the chocolate lava cookie. This is definitely a dish for a person with a sweet tooth. Overall, the combination of the hot cookie and the cold ice cream is great and the chocolate is thick. This costs around $12 if I remember correctly. Great tasting experience!"
Kooks Creamery,"We tried the chocolate lava cookie with pistachio ice cream ($12.40) and recommend this combi if you’re thinking what goes well with chocolate.  The cookie is on the soft, doughy side, and less sinful than I imagined because the inside of the cookie was filled with chocolate lava so you’re mostly just eating ice cream with chocolate sauce, and some cookie. But because it was heated up, it gave the ice cream an extra dimension and really comforting to eat."
Kooks Creamery,"If you're craving for a piping hot yet cold sweet dessert, this is the place for you! Came here for the 1st time with my friend and we had the Matcha Lava cookie with Ferrero Rocher Ice-cream. The plate was super hot and so was the oozing soft cookie. Great bang for the buck and dessert after dinner with friends.  Water is not complimentary and space wise is a bit small."
Kooks Creamery,"Came here during Sunday evening, no crowd at all. Btw No sampling of ice cream.  Ordered the choco lava cookie with match ice cream. Lava cookie is served hot and flowy. Not too sweet. Cookie is not too big, can finish within 5 mouths.  Matcha ice cream is dense and have enough flavour.  Overall was satisfying for the lava craving. Forget about lava cakes, just come here for lava cookies.  However Matcha ice cream seems to be priced on the higher side. Was charged $13.80, choco lava cookie is $7 which makes a scoop of matcha ice cream $6.80."
Kooks Creamery,"ice cream n cookie was SO nice n yummy (wld give the food 4 stars) but TERRIBLE customer service … in particular, there was a short indian lady was so unfriendly and rude. visited on 1 may 8pm. she was so unwilling to let us try the ice cream too. after i tried 1 flavour, she was like “ready?” and had a hostile air when i wanted to try my third flavour. it was quite obvious bc she was chatting happily with the other employee and stopped while i was trying. on paying, i had forgot to add the shopback promo before paying and she didn’t allow to refund & pay again, even though i know they are able to do so on the app (have been refunded at other tenants on shopback before). i don’t mind if you don’t let me refund but it wouldn’t hurt to be a little friendlier and smile more. overall just a sour experience at this outlet even tho the food was good. wont be returning again."
Kooks Creamery,"Liked the idea of serving ice-cream on freshly baked hot lava cookies. Everything just blended in so well especially when u have it messy. They offer a good variety of ice-cream flavours. We tried the Rocher & dark chocolate. The Rocher was nice and flavourful but dark chocolate wasn't bitter enough. Overall the whole dessert blended together well but personally I feel that the sweetness of the whole dessert was a little overpowering. Maybe I'll try the other flavours next time round. Item prices are slightly on the steep side. Staff here are quite attentive, the clear table very quickly once customers have left. The alfresco area quite warm as there isn't any fan or perhaps then can lift up the roller blinds on warm evenings. Overall we enjoyed our dessert and will come back to try more of what they gotta offer. :face_savoring_food::face_savoring_food::face_savoring_food::face_savoring_food::face_savoring_food:"
Kooks Creamery,Chocolate lava cookie was mediocre even though it has a star. I recommend the pink ruby lava cookie instead. The matcha ice cream is more of the bitter instead of milky type; depends on your preference. Total cost was $32.50. Prepare to spend at least $5-$10 per person.
Kooks Creamery,"When we asked to sample a flavour, he was extremely ungenerous as shown in the 1st picture. Funnily insulting 1*  We bought 2 scoops - earl grey and pistachios flavours.  Earl grey is on the heavy side. It’s like tea gao siu dai. 2*  Pistachio is quite heavily flavoured and it’s definitely one of the better one in town. 4*"
Kooks Creamery,"My first time trying lava cookies and it's really :melting_face::melting_face: the texture between gooey and crusty is JUST right. The matcha cookie is my fav... and goes really well w choc icecream!!  Unfortunately the cereal milk flavour was a bit too light for me, but maybe the other flavours were all too strong hahaha."
Kooks Creamery,Chanced upon this shop while walking around. The ice cream was not so sweet and was nice. Staff was kind enough to tell us to come back to have the lava cookie as it is best eaten there. Will definitely be going back to try the other flavors and the lava cookie.
FLOR Patisserie,The ambience is ok and the staffs are nice. But quite pricey. Drinks and cake on the average. Fruit cooler is super sour!
FLOR Patisserie,"Dropped in quickly on a walk by to see what pastries they had and found a ""weekend only"" item. Fortunately it was Friday so I could enjoy the soft milk chocolate tart with a flaky pie crust and covered with large sweet orange cubes of mango. Chocolate and mango is a terrific combination.  I paired it with a decent long black coffee, served the proper temperature, and was lightly acidic to offset the sweet fruit. Indoor seating available."
FLOR Patisserie,"Perfect place to chill on a weekday afternoon. The decor / paintings change monthly. While we were there, the artist of the month were hosting visors.  Goma crepe cake was so good, nutty and not too sweet. Rare flavour of crepe cake. Add on hot drink as a set is $2 off. Burdock tea (comes without sugar). Went well with the pastries. Friend ordered the signature strawberry cake and a coffee.  Stayed for a couple hours. Clean toilet for patrons"
FLOR Patisserie,"The environment is good and not crowded. They selling very unique cheese tart with different kind of flavor, Earl grey cheese tart are the best !"

FLOR Patisserie,"Ordered sliced cakes from them and the cakes were yummy, especially the strawberry shortcake which was light and good. For delivery, the cakes were packed nicely and received in good condition. Thankful that delivery service was there when we needed some sweets during the circuit breaker period."
FLOR Patisserie,Very nice strawberry souffle and Waguri millefeuille. They served in their custom make plate with a word “Flor” which from their shop name. Due to hot weather we having their only cold drink which are cold brewed.
FLOR Patisserie,Great Japanese (IMO) Patisserie in the East Coast SG for a good coffee /tea time experience.  Cakes are really good (loved my Strawberry Shortcake) with Iced Coffee without sugar syrup. Really on par with established names like Henri Carpentier on the shortcake.
FLOR Patisserie,Special flavour.. The Passion Fruit Chiffon Cake. It smell soooo nice and soft to the bite. Not too sweet too and can keep for days in the chillier without compromising on the quality :thumbs_up::smiling_face_with_open_hands: but the price about $16/chiffon #msgreedysis #greedybuddiez
FLOR Patisserie,Strawberry shortcake and cold brew! Cake was pretty good but wouldn’t come back specially for it. Love their plates tho. Cold brew is more on the darker and bitter side so not all might enjoy. Staff was really nice and helped to shift the table to a shadier side as it was really hot that day. Total was $19.89. :smiling_face_with_tear:
FLOR Patisserie,"Having our leisure tea break here, with the cake set come with drinks. We had been ordered the Strawberry souffle and Yuzu Chocolate cake set with 2 tea coolers. The Yuzu Chocolate cake is very nice taste is the taste I like the most. They also selling plants here!"
FLOR Patisserie,The service staff at this outlet are very friendly and i really enjoyed the baking workshop by Heidi . There is not much washing required and you can have unlimited free flow of good quality drinks! Flor sells very authentic baking ingredients mainly imported from Japan and ofcos very high quality baked goods. Love it!
FLOR Patisserie,"FLOR Patisserie can be described as a Japanese-Style Cakes Cafe With Botanical Theme located along Upper East Coast Road.  The Siglap outlet works as their central kitchen. Unlike their other outlets in Duxton and Capitol Singapore with a white and minimalist theme, this outlet has a more Scandinavian design with cemented walls and flooring, equipped with clean, simple furniture and natural sunlight.  As “Flor” is a Portuguese word for “flower”, you would see traces of flowers and plants whether in their cake presentation or in their interior.  Using mainly fresh fruits which are lighter in flavour than conventional French pastries, I enjoyed the soft, light, and airy texture whereas the matcha taste was on the fainter side. Their cake slices are delicious,  light, and refreshing. Will definitely dine next time.  The shop offers a make-your-own cake & dessert workshop, which is new and interesting."
FLOR Patisserie,"Upon arrival to pick up the tart, the staffs were already staring at us strangely from the inside - was just taking photos of the pretty shop front from the outside. They were even unfriendlier when we were inside - the staff with her fringe covering one of her eyes, no name tag so couldn't tell who was who. She spoke to us in a very unwilling and flat tone, she seemed irritated. Customer service? The other staff was much friendlier.  I was pretty shocked when I checked the tart, was thoroughly disappointed and died inside as it was for a friend's 30th birthday, I paid $96.30 for a 18cm strawberry tart that looks just like any regular tart. Friends even thought it was from Chateraise, which was fine but I'd be paying half the price if I got it from there. Tart was shallow, photos online looked like it had more depth, but hey you know what they say, ""Never believe what you see online."" Fruits tasted fresh though, only a tinge of yuzu flavour but pastry tart tasted SO NORMAL, you can get it from anywhere else. Tasted like a fruit tart I can find at Chateraise too! How bad can strawberries taste on a tart?  Also bought their signature sweet potato cream roll, had no sweet potato taste. No idea what was going on, if I got the wrong flavour or not?  The price and disappointing flavours aside, the cafe had good vibes and atmosphere but there was no one in sight. Not patronising the Upper East Coast outlet again, based on other reviews, this outlet had more negative reviews compared to the rest. I should've read the reviews before coming, lesson learned! Don't know how they managed to get onto Expats Choice.  Photos attached have been colour edited."
FLOR Patisserie,"I was very disappointed in their cake and follow ups. Ordered a number cake for my baby's first birthday, the piping came uncompleted and edges were bruised.  I emailed them the day after but there were no replies. I followed up and they came back with a 5% discount for $190 cake after one month, which was pretty sad for an unfinished decoration birthday cake. I wrote back to them but they ignored my emails again.  Flor's cakes are priced pretty steep, I will expect better output and quality control. And if you screw up someone's birthday cake, please be responsive and sincere in your apologies. I hate to write a bad review but if you are so unresponsive and insincere, I have no choice but to flag you out."
Birds of Paradise,Simply one of the best ice cream venues in the city. Their selection of flavours are carefully curated and clearly carefully created too. I loved way too many of the flavours on offer to try them all. From the ones I picked - thoroughly enjoyed all of them.  If you like cones then this is the place for you - they have some herbs mixed in to their waffle cones that not only smell amazing but compliment many of the flavours on offer as well.  Ice cream fan? Don’t miss it.
Birds of Paradise,Rich in flavour and very smooth. We ordered sea salt houjicha and dark chocolate sorbet. Both were really enjoyable. Waffle cone is really fragrant and crispy
Birds of Paradise,"No trying of taste which is a meh. When I went to Hundred Acre Wood Creamery, I was allowed to try. The I did not like what I bought - Strawberry Basil. $18 a pint is expensive for its size. The ice cream at Hundred Acre tasted a lot better. I will not return."
Birds of Paradise,Tasty gelato. Patient staff and happy to explain all the flavours. Pistachio and spiced pear was great. Earl grey lemongrass was nice but very slight hint of lemongrass. The lemongrass ginger was so so.
Birds of Paradise,Amazing ice cream!! Tried the roasted sesame and the taste is just perfect ☆ Staff is friendly. I will come back for sure and try the dark chocolate sorbet next time. Will also buy their ice cream box to take home as it is value for money! :red_heart:
Birds of Paradise,I tried the Macadamia Butterfly Pea and it was delicious with the cone! $6.8 for 1. Scoop size was big. But testers weren’t available which is very unfortunate :( no free water either.. They have interesting flavours like Strawberry Basil & White Chrysanthemum.
Birds of Paradise,"Such a cute place! You can never go wrong by getting an ice-cream from here, so delicious! Try their freshly made cones, they are really crunchy and fragrant.  I also like their cute little ""map"" where you can see the profile of different flavours. Some of them are really unique."
Birds of Paradise,My fav gelato place in Singapore! The flavors are unique and it’s not as sweet as others in the vicinity. The only downside is that there’s no sampling so you have to sort of trust your gut and judge according to the diagram they provide.  Top favorites are white chrysanthemum and earl grey lemongrass.  Cashless only. There’s limited seating at the back of the shop.
Birds of Paradise,Unique and refreshing flavors of ice creams that  I personally do not see often elsewhere. Quality refreshment and deserts. it's something that is just worth to try.  *Could be better if they get a bigger space for dine in. It's just hard to finish the ice cream along the narrow sidewalks of Joo Chiat.
Birds of Paradise,"try one of the ice cream that is happening in singapore.  and try the white chrysanthemum flower flavour.  it tastes good, especially on a hot day it is very suitable.  the cone is also crispy because they make it themselves.  it costs S$6 and here is cashless.  but unfortunately there are minimal seats here, so it's more suitable for take away"
Birds of Paradise,"Always noticed this ice cream shop in jewel with long queue but now found a branch that i can enjoy my cone with less to no crowd. Loved the minimalistic interior, the freshly made waffle is always inviting, a good spread of unique ice cream flavors. Will come back again."
Birds of Paradise,"Stunning modern design, peaceful and breathy. Many local flavors, as well as typical. The taste can be better, as not much flavor there, unfortunately. Tried coconut (wasn’t good), pistachio (good), strawberry & basil (I liked it)."
Birds of Paradise,"Such a nice space and atmosphere with excellent choices of ice cream and sorbet flavors. We tried the Osmanthus Pear Sorbet and Earl Grey & Lemongrass. Both were great, loved the special flavors"
Birds of Paradise,"I am sure this ice cream chain is no stranger to many, I always see super long queues at the outlets in East Coast and Jewel. I did not expect it to be so good until I tried it here. The ice cream is smooth and creamy, and with just right sweetness level. I had the strawberry basil, and it is really what is says - fruity, herbaceous, and fresh. I like the cone too, that you can watch it made fresh at the shop. This will be my goto place for ice-cream next time when I crave for one."
Birds of Paradise,"Stumbled on this awesome gelato place while walking around Arab Street. There's a nice air condition outside area to sit and you get gelato, and the flavors are outstanding. Try the midnight and the Earl Grey lemongrass!"
Birds of Paradise,"Sweet Symphony of Flavors! :ice_cream::herb:  Soar to new taste heights with 'Birds of Paradise' gelato and sorbet, where artistry meets top-quality ingredients.  Delight in the harmonious blend of natural botanical essences and creamy textures that transport your taste buds to a world of pure indulgence. Each scoop is a journey through a garden of delightful flavors that leaves you craving for more.  Treat yourself to the finest frozen delights and experience the joy of 'Birds of Paradise'!"
Birds of Paradise,"The ice cream flavors are so creative, you cannot find them elsewhere... and they are all interesting and delicious.  We've tried lychee raspberry, salty hojicha and earlgrey lemongrass.  Price is a bit high, but for the fanciness and flavors... it's worth every penny!"
Birds of Paradise,"Always a long queue, finally able to try it saw the queue was lesser than before. After me, there was starting a long queue after dinner hours. Indeed was worth the queue! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! Love the gelato very much and would definitely come back for more to try the rest of their flavour.  Love the outlook of the packaging and their minimalist interior. Trying their best seller: White Chrysanthemum Lychee Raspberry Pistachio Sea-salt Hojicha"
Birds of Paradise,"Amazing Gelato at a reasonable price. Earl Grey with Lemongrass is earthy and refreshing. Pistachio is nutty, fresh, and taste 100% like the real deal, no artificial flavouring. Totally recommended this two flavour. Definitely get their Gelato with cone too, as the cone itself is crispy and fragrant."
Birds of Paradise,"DEFINITELY ONE OF THE BEST ICECREAM IN TOWN! Introduced to this gelato by a gf and has been hooked ever since. A must have whenever I'm in Jewel. Have tried more than half of the flavors available so far and they have been delicious! You can taste whatever flavor it's supposed to be without getting overwhelmed as it is really light and yummy! Personal favorites are the lemongrass, seasalt hojicha and roasted sesame! Do order it with the cone as their cones are thyme flavored and is so addictive! The double scoop is more value for money so go for that! The queue moves fast so dont be deterred by it, it's worth the wait."
Monarchs & Milkweed Gelato,"Hidden along the street. Tried 2 flavours!  Burnt white chocolate - 9/10 It has a white chocolate caramel flavour with chocolate bits so it adds a crunch when you eat the ice cream. Not too creamy and sweet!  Wildflower honey - 7/10 If you like something light, this is a go to but if you want something stronger in taste, would recommend you to try smth else!  Seating capacity of the cafe is small so we stood outside to eat."
Monarchs & Milkweed Gelato,"Quite crowded on a Friday night (expected), but service staff was quite friendly and accommodating. Cookie butter crunch was lovely, very flavourful yet not overly sweet. Ispahan was not too bad, and waffle was rather average. A pity they don’t allow you to sample other flavours."
Monarchs & Milkweed Gelato,Ice cream had the perfect amount of sweetness with strong natural flavours. Rich and creamy texture paired with their classic waffle that was crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. Worth the calories and wait. Friendly staff and nice atmosphere!
Monarchs & Milkweed Gelato,"Rating: 3.5 stars  It’s quite good, but the texture is more like ice cream than gelato (tbh I would not even call it gelato). Like others have said, I found it to be not as good as competitors and overpriced, which is why I bumped it down. ($5.50 for regular scoop)  I got the honey wildflower and burnt white chocolate. I enjoyed the honey wildflower more!  Overall: Mmm not sure if I’d return again because there are better options in the same area."
Monarchs & Milkweed Gelato,"Home made artisanal gelato with many interesting & creative flavour. We like the brown butter sage, pistachio, lychee rose, burnt white chocolate. The vibe is cozy & bright, popular among young people.  Good place for a dessert after dinner or just catch up with friends."
Fluffstack Café Pancakes,"SUPREME pancakes, I can’t believe they were so so soft, it was so easy to slice the pancake and the taste was super delicious! We ordered a mango passion fruit pancake and it was just the right amount of sweet. We got our order only after 10-15 mins or so, but I had no issues with that because the quality of the pancakes was :pinched_fingers: Probably one of the best and fluffiest pancakes I’ve ever had. I’d recommend getting two pancakes and sharing it with a friend so that you can enjoy their different delicious pancakes (and also cuz the pancakes are expensive… the mango one itself was for 16.50!) The ambiance was also so vibrant and cute, definitely going to come here again!"
Fluffstack Café Pancakes,"Another Highly Recommended Souffle Pancake！  Ordered Hazelnut Chcocolate with Salted Caramel. It is a Sinfully Delicious :lollipop:  Most fluffy! Sweetness is just right! Now I have to go back again…  Fluff Stack (Suntec) Address: 3 Temasek Boulevard, #B1-K4 West Atrium, Suntec City Mall, Singapore 038983"
Fluffstack Café Pancakes,"This place offers perfect pillow-y souffle pancakes with various toppings. The mango one comes with an enormous half of mango which adds to the deliciousness to the dish. They also offer durian pancakes which we decided to try. Well, what can I say - durian is definitely not for everyone and one should order it for their own risk. Pancakes were still good, even with durian.  Order at the counter and they go take a seat. They will serve the dish once ready to the table.  Interestingly when we ordered two dishes - they brought them one by one, not at the same time. I am not sure whether this is what they do their or whether it was just a misunderstanding.  The vibe is quite nice. But mind that the location is in the middle of the crowded food market in the enormous office/shopping mall. There are always lots of people around and the seating area is hardly separated. Seating area is quite small and limited."
Fluffstack Café Pancakes,Ordered a Mango passion fruit and it tastes great! Gave a 4 stars because the pricing stated was without gst. The dish was $16.50 but it turned out to be $19.60 with gst and service charge. Normally dessert shops I go to are nett price.
Fluffstack Café Pancakes,"Went there on a weekday right before lunch time and it was blissfully empty. We ordered two sets of the regular souffle pancakes and they were great! Super fluffy and the salted butter by the side was really what I wanted. It can get super crowded on weekends, so try to avoid going at that time if possible."
Fluffstack Café Pancakes,Convenient place to fix souffle pancake craving. Generally enjoy their pancakes. Have tried their hazelnut choc & mango coconut and both are solid in terms of flavour and ingredients used. Price a bit on the higher side tho
Fluffstack Café Pancakes,"Came on a weekday and food arrived quite fast. The pancake was also freshly made upon order. However, for the price it’s definitely a much more pricer desert option."
Fluffstack Café Pancakes,"The souffle pancakes were slightly overcooked but still great!  The mango passionfruit came with a whole mango! And, it’s sweet! Passionfruit is tangy but goes great with the pancakes and mango.  Tiramisu is pretty decent but nothing to write about.  Strawberry cheese is really good! Everything is well balanced on the menu.  I highly recommend the earl grey ice cream. Best earl grey ice cream I ever had. Strong taste of tea and perfect amount sweetness, great way to end the meal:relieved_face:  Staff were friendly, pancake wait time was to be expected. I went on a weekday lunch time and the shop was totally empty."
Fluffstack Café Pancakes,"Ordered Salted Caramel Pancakes. The Pancakes were fluffy, the salted caramel sauce was good too. Nice dessert to share with people. The staff were friendly too.  Do note you will have to wait 15-20mins for the pancake to be prepared so for people who are a little tight on time, I would not recommend you to come. Also during peak hours the waiting time can be long, be ready to wait a minimum of 30 minutes before being seated in the outlet.  Other than that the food is good and service staff were nice and friendly."
Fluffstack Café Pancakes,"""1838"" Classic... their food is so yummy. For me, this one serving is good for two since I eat small amout but for the ice cream nahhh... good for 1 person only hahaha :grinning_squinting_face:."
Fluffstack Café Pancakes,Recently we tried the desserts at Fluff Stack @ PLQ mall on a weekday after our lunch . We ordered the mango passion fruit souffle pancake and croffles. Both desserts tasted quite ordinary though the dessert presentation is appealing. Prices are also on the high side.
Fluffstack Café Pancakes,"Nice fluffy pancakes, consistent with what we used to get at the Tampines One outlet. However, it took 20 min after ordering for the pancakes to be served, even though the outlet was only half filled at the time. This was a surprise because the Tampines One outlet usually took half this time, even when it was full. It is a pity that the Tampines One outlet is now closed."
Fluffstack Café Pancakes,"Had went past this restaurant a couple of times. Finally, we decided to walk in and give it a go.  We had Strawberry Cheese Pancake and Classic 1838 Classic Croffles with one scoop of salted caramel. Both cost $14.50 each and were photo ready.  We thought the croffles tasted better and better value for money while the pancakes were fluffy and less sweet."
Fluffstack Café Pancakes,After meal dessert at Fluffstack to share with my friend. Took awhile before our dessert was served because they made the souffle on the spot. A mix of sweet and sour taste coming from the mango and passion fruit which made the overall taste just right. Just that the souffle ain't jiggly. Ordered teas to go with the dessert too. They used Gryphon tea bags. Halal dessert place so more options for Muslim friends.
Fluffstack Café Pancakes,"Really really ordinary. Feels like a pop up cafe in the middle of Paya Lebar Mall, decided to pop in for a drink as there were no other customers at the time. We ordered some cold brew coffee and sparkling tea, both of which were nice but not outstanding. Since these were bottled drinks, i dont think the cafe brewed them but merely got them from another brand.  Also ordered a stack of fluffy pancakes with passion fruit syrup. The combination didn't go very well as the syrup was slightly sour. The pancakes did jiggle for our photos but the taste was also very ordinary. Pass!"
Fluffstack Café Pancakes,"The souffle served cold on the outside, a little warm in the inside. Very fast served in 1min after we took our seats. Probably cook before hand stored on the stove. Hazelnut Chocolate is sweet. Strawberry is sour. Overall: Good. I would suggest cook on the spot after customers placed the order"
Fluffstack Café Pancakes,"The location of this outlet is very humid, suffocating as they don’t have their own air conditioner; like a pop-up store. Plus the arcade is behind so it’s noisy to some extent. Come when you’re feeling on cloud nine otherwise, be prepared to feel pekcek with everything ;) Food is good nonetheless."
Fluffstack Café Pancakes,"Good pit stop if you are craving for pancakes. As the name suggests, they have one of the fluffiest pancakes in town. My favourite is the salted caramel. It comes smothered with their beautiful foamy cream which helps balance the sweetness from the caramel. A great add on is the ice-cream. It pushes the experience up a notch. I would recommend the Earl Grey Ice-cream to go with the Salted caramel pancake. Overall, I rate Fluff Stack highly."
Fluffstack Café Pancakes,They may look pretty but I really don’t think they’re worth their price. Lacking in flavour and texture. Ice cream is just ordinary.
Fluffstack Café Pancakes,"Like both the Soffle Pancake and the Croffle. Both were done pretty well, and the accompanying vanilla ice cream were nice too, thick and not too sweet.  Just realized I had also ordered 3 macarons as add-ons, which was not served. Hopefully they will honour it, if I check with them the next time I visit."
GRAM Pancakes,"First time trying out this place on a weekend tea break timing. No Q. Got seated. About 50% occupied. Well renovated, bright. Order the Lotus flavour. Looks good but taste normal. The pancake is slightly dry inside for my liking. Price is around SGD 20 per order. I would say the overall experience is about 3.5 stars."
GRAM Pancakes,Still the best pancakes in Singapore. Premium pancake is still my favourite. New lava pancake is nice too. Fruit tea is refreshing Wagyu rice and prawn miso pasta are delicious. Nice ambience Will be back for more.
GRAM Pancakes,"Was reluctant to try it for the longest time due to the history of how this place came about. But gave in recently as I was cravings for pancakes.  Went on a weekday dinner and the place was quite empty, only 2 other tables were taken. The pancake was surprisingly good. It was not too airy like fluff pancakes, very well balanced on the palate and I like that there was a hint of saltiness.  In my opinion, the chocolate one is better than the biscoff :smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes: we had a plate each and it was unexpectedly filling."
GRAM Pancakes,"Visited the Gram outlet at Vivo, which is located at L2. We visited on a weekday at around 7ish, and the cafe is practically empty.  We ordered a biscoff flavoured souffle pancake. Tasted fluffy decent, with a nice drizzle of sauce, generous cream and lotus biscuits, with some fruits as a side.  The issue is we saw some cockroach-looking insects crawling in the restaurant. That was concerning and off-putting, and we immediately left after finishing the pancake. What a downer!"
GRAM Pancakes,"Gram Cafe & Pancakes has to be one of the best places in Singapore for souffle pancakes!! Their Premium Pancakes are a must-try, especially the Original, Lotus Biscuit, & Matcha versions!! The thick fluffiness of these Premium Pancakes combine perfectly with the respective toppings such as butter, whippwd cream, maple sauce, & ice cream to create a magically sumptuous dessert."
GRAM Pancakes,"Mommas Day Brunch. :pancakes: Excellent pancakes and all-day breakfast menu. Fluffy souffle pancakes for special days. Great variety available on the menu.:bacon::cooking: Service was a little laggy, but they were trying their best!! Good hard work.. Simple ambience, not rowdy. Instagrammable food and soft interior.."
GRAM Pancakes,"BEST FLUFFFFY WOBBLY PANCAKES! (Scroll down to see the wobble:sparkles::eyes:) It was so fluffy and soooooo delishhhhhh I loved the pancake! I got the biscoff flavour and it was SO GOOOOOOD!! Also, they have a cool and interesting concept here— pay after meal. That is rare in SG and really pleasant! Anyway the fooood was so good and overall I loved it to bits! Really nice place and really great staff. Perfect for dessert, can’t wait to be back :growing_heart: I had a great experience here!"
GRAM Pancakes,"@gram_pancakes_singapore opens up their 2nd outlet at Waterway Point, officially from 12th July 2021.  To celebrate this joyous occasion, they have partnered up with @hersheys to launch their limited edition, Gram x Hershey's Premium Chocolate Lava Pancake ($20.90 - 1st photo) that has delicious chocolate filling weaved deeply inside the pancake. For ones who have a sweet tooth, you may indulge further by enveloping the pancake with more Hershey's chocolate.  Aside from that, they have also introduced savoury dishes such as their Golden Red Miso Prawn Pasta ($10.90 - 3rd Photo), Fried Togarashi Pink Salmon Fillet ($20.90 - 4th Photo) & Wagyu Beef Mini Don ($11.90 - 5th Photo).  We also ordered their Gram's Fruit Tea to top off our sensory experience over here, which is a great idea as it helps to gently cleanse our palate too.  "
GRAM Pancakes,Overall food is awesome . I love the grilled salmon dish and ice fruit tea . Iced fruit tea has a deep fruity flavor that I absolutely love . Kids meal is reasonable with 2 slices of mini pancakes fruits and caramelized sweet sausages cut like octopus :octopus:  The duck bento and don was Abit disappointing as the serving size was terribly small . Was shocked at how little it was despite it being $14.90 for the curry duck katsu bento.  Overall would come bk for the atmosphere and iced fruit tea . But not for the meals as I find it more worthy to get the desserts here and enjoy time with family and friends . Friendly staff but kinda slow in service .
GRAM Pancakes,"dined in at wwp 23 july 15:08h and the place was half-packed. i used to dine here v frequently when the manager (i think) was still here along with afew other elderly staff, which were way more professional compared to now. i stopped coming in since their staff changed 100% no idea why. i was served by an indian male staff and he was very nice. though there were many other staff working (part time younger females), i saw that only the male staff which brought me to my table was serving the food, which honestly gives me a bad impression of this store now. the female staff were just walking around, or at the cashier and almost nowhere to be seen at times. its really unfair to the male staff imo, if you are employed to work in fnb, regardless of yr gender, do your job. or get fired lol. only the male staff was cleaning the tables. i was there for about 1hr"
Sweet Reservations,"I must say that the watermelon bingsu (S) is a minimalistic delight with only three ingredients – refreshing watermelon, finely shaved ice, and a touch of vanilla ice cream. The symphony of flavors is harmonious, yet the experience leaves me craving more complexity. The price of $7.80 seems fair for the quality of ingredients and presentation.  Additionally, I ordered two servings of the Chocolate ice cream with marshmallow (Rocky Road) priced at $4.50 each. While it satisfied my sweet tooth, the taste was merely average, lacking that wow factor to elevate it above standard ice cream fare.  Overall, the establishment offers decent desserts, but I couldn't help but wish for more innovation and distinction in their offerings to truly leave a lasting impression."
Sweet Reservations,Specially came here for dessert as the first 2 times were not bad when I ate their Earl Grey BBT bingsu but 3rd time was a disappointment. We decided to give their waffle mix a try and it was a miss because I ordered red velvet and mocha but the order served was wrong (pandan and buttermilk). Not worth the money too as the waffles tasted basic and too dry. We didn’t inform the staff as the place was a bit busy and we didn’t want to wait for a change of waffles. The bingsu was too sweet and the ice cream didn’t have much earl grey taste too. Safe to say I probably won’t be back again.  Update: They refunded me for the waffles after this. Appreciate the prompt follow-up!
Sweet Reservations,Super delicious bingsu probably the best I've tasted yet! Owner was friendly too highly recommended :thumbs_up:
Sweet Reservations,"My go to place for a quick and icy dessert!  Chanced upon this gem in COVID days and have been ordering from them every now and then ever since.  Here’s how much I like it: Ordered an Injeolmi Bingsu on Grabfood on Sat night and it was so delicious! Been thinking about it the next day, Hence got another injeolmi bingsu along with a red bean bingsu on Monday :face_with_hand_over_mouth:  PS. Shout out to Desmond for agreeing to my request for extra milk every time I order!"
Sweet Reservations,"Today was really a hot day and I just decided to get some icy dessert to beat the heat! Not knowing where to go I started the Google for Bingsu and here we are!:grinning_face_with_sweat::grinning_face_with_sweat::grinning_face_with_sweat: Me and hubby decide to go with our favourite fruit Mango and MSW Durian and it was simply awesome!!!! Hubby loves the fluffy ice and I loves the chunky fruit on top of it!...All in all...everything on the bowl compliment each other.....:red_heart::red_heart::red_heart::red_heart: Beautiful presentation, taste great and very wonderful vibe here, very clean and im walking down memory lane with all my favourite songs..and most importantly GREAT SERVICE!!!:smiling_face_with_heart-eyes::smiling_face_with_heart-eyes::smiling_face_with_heart-eyes: We already had in mind what we gonna have the next visit we are here...:face_with_open_eyes_and_hand_over_mouth::face_with_open_eyes_and_hand_over_mouth::face_with_open_eyes_and_hand_over_mouth: Thank you for the great eating experience here:two_hearts::two_hearts::two_hearts:"
Whiskdom,Really good. Had the eggsplode and the truffle chicken sandwich and enjoyed it all. The portions are generous so you could probably get away with sharing one bagle with another person and leave satisfied.  Seating is available but easiest for groups of two to sit. Then I had the chance to eat the chunky chocolate chip and the ration of chocolate to cookie was perfect for me. I like more chocolate and it was nice and soft and a think serving.  Staff was really nice and helpful. Can't wait to try the rest of the menu
Whiskdom,Lovely cookies and brownies in terms of taste and aesthetics. Oozy lava texture. Best taken with a cup of (sugarless) Americano or Earl Grey tea! Makes a perfect gift too with their simple yet presentable paper box packaging! I think they serve coffee now too!
Whiskdom,"Dined-in at about 3pm on a weekday. The snacks were absolutely delicious & mouthwatering :drooling_face: The staff that served us (the hijabi) was absolutely friendly & welcoming!  However, the aircon could be stronger as we were feeling hot while dining-in. The other customers at the nearby table had the same remark.  There was also NO coffee?! (Despite all the coffee photos at their shop window…):loudly_crying_face: The only drinks they had were matcha latte and oolong tea, which was average.  Overall, highly recommended for delicious cookies & brownies — but maybe takeaway is better!"
Whiskdom,"The 𝙆-𝘽𝙖𝙚-𝙂𝙚𝙡 ($15.90) was STACKED with thick juicy chicken, kimchi slaw, and their housemade gochujang aioli. We were absolutely blown away by the sauce - it was savoury and tangy, and we just couldn’t get enough of it. We’d buy their sauce if they sold it by the bottles! The sauce was generously slathered and this combination of korean-inspired flavours just worked damn well. This is a must-get! :index_pointing_up_light_skin_tone::index_pointing_up_light_skin_tone:  The 𝙀𝙜𝙜𝙨𝙥𝙡𝙤𝙙𝙚 ($12.90) was visually stunning :star-struck::cooking: the egg mayo was oozing out and it was a gorgeous sea of yellow and white, with a ooeygooey yolk from the soft boiled egg, topped with generous furikake. It was a messy affair, with eggs dropping out left right centre and it will definitely be hit with egg lovers! :heart_hands_light_skin_tone: Our only qualm is that the bagel is served cold, which we can understand since egg mayo is usually chilled.  We went with their dreamy 𝙒𝙝𝙞𝙨𝙠𝙙𝙤𝙢 𝙂𝙖𝙡𝙖𝙭𝙮 ($6.90) :milky_way: to quench our thirst. This was a concoction of blue pea tea, soda, and strawberry Konjac pearls :strawberry:. Taste-wise, it tastes like your usual soda :grinning_face_with_sweat: but the pearls added chew to the drink, and it’s rlly instagrammable! We also got the 𝙊𝙤𝙡𝙤𝙣𝙜 𝘾𝙡𝙤𝙪𝙙 ($5.90) :cloud:  a light tea topped with milk foam. The milk foam was smooth and the drink overall enjoyable.  IG: @toofoodtomiss for more foodie content!"
Whiskdom,"Tried the Eggsplode bagel and the chunky chocolate chip cookie.  The  bagel was generously portioned and the furikake gave a nice contrast to the monotony of the egg mayo, but it still got a bit jelak by the 2nd half of the bagel. It tasted good but would be better if shared.  Cookie was hefty and was packed in a nice box. Heated it before consuming and the texture was good but the taste was not especially memorable (could just be the flavour I picked). Would still be keen to try the other flavours and the brownies too in the future!  Staff was friendly but seating space is very limited so be prepared to takeaway."
Whiskdom,"Heard good things about cookies here so decided to try . The cookies are indeed not bad here at ooze. Bought the classic flavours chocolate/creme brûlee and also the other matcha one The chocolate one was already very good, but will try the other two as well. Cookies were around $6-6.5 each"
Whiskdom,"I stood there for quite long and the staff were chatting while doing their own things (probably thinking I was deciding), then when another customer got their attention to order, they took their own sweet time, and yet after serving her, almost wanted to ignore me again :melting_face: (honestly being in 3rd trimester pregnant I suddenly wasn’t too used to the “under-treatment” - not like I think all pregnant women should get special treatment but it doesn’t feel good being ignored standing there for so long). Tried the chocolate overload cookie and the peanut butter brownie. The inside is way too dry, we would personally prefer the middle being more gooey… Also the tastes are kind of dull. We struggled to finish before they closed. My husband loves the camping set up at the seating area."
Whiskdom,":round_pushpin:Ooze by Whiskdom - located at level 4 of Orchard Central.  :grinning_face_with_big_eyes: Happened to pass by and Ooze seems interesting with combi of cookies and brownies! Decided to give it a try!  :cookie: A varied selection of big chunky ooey-gooey cookies and oozing brownies, mainly with chocolate base.  :face_savoring_food: Got a box of 6 after some recommendations from the friendly staff. Great bakes in a pretty box! Awesome! Not too sweet :thumbs_up: and my fav is the Matcha!  :megaphone: Recommended!!"
Whiskdom,"as a cookie lover, the cookies here were not bad! we had the chocolate chip and matcha lava cookies, as well as the white chrysanthemum nut and brown butter ice cream. the cookies were decadent and not too sweet, and the ice cream were very interesting and unique. however, both were on the slightly pricier side. they have many interesting flavours of both cookies, brownies, bagels and ice cream. for both savoury and sweet lovers, I would definitely recommend you try this place at least once!"
Whiskdom,"As an avid matcha fan trying matcha everywhere, the matcha here (both latte and cookie!) truly beats expectations. Perfect blend of flavours. Highly recommend warming cookies up for gooey goodness!"
Whiskdom,"Great add on to Raffles Place dining options. Tried the mentaiko bagel and beef tater tots, bagel bun is soft yet crispy, chicken portion is generous. Shredded beef with tots are good but would prefer to have them served separately so tots wont go soggy fast. Automation for queue and service of staff can be improved."
Whiskdom,"I saw whiskdom at geylang serai and now they open up an outlet here at Raffles Place excited :star-struck: I tried their truffle beef bagel recommended by a lot of food blogger ! It’s a bomb ! Too all my muslim friends , they use all halal ingredients and today I’m buying cookies from them :drooling_face: :cookie: The staff is professional and friendly 5/5"
Whiskdom,"Omg hands down best truffle beef bagel in SG! Not only that... every drink i've tried was delicious (add oat milk) and dont get me started on their cookies and brownies. Dont believe me? Buy their Chunky Choc Chip and try. Whiskdom... after discovering yall, i completely lost whatever little will i have left to lose weight. FML."
Whiskdom,"Tried their beef bagel for lunch. Initial thoughts: Overpriced and underwhelming.  Despite the beef being of decent quality, it lacked flavour. 80% of any flavour came from the nacho cheese."
Whiskdom,"Saw this cafe on Instagram and came with my friends today and we bought their classic beef bageI, Was really moist and flavourful. My friend bought the cookie with the custard filling and shared it with me and it was pretty good:drooling_face: will buy it home the next time for my family :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes: Didn't manage to snap a pic because they all gobble it up too quickly :loudly_crying_face:"
Old Village,The owner is so passionate to share about the art of tea drinking while introducing me the various Pu Er tea that he has before I decide which to purchase. I enjoyed my visit at OVP yesterday morning and thanks for the tea tasting session!
Old Village,"Interesting shop, friendly owner. My wife loves puer and I am beginning to appreciate the taste too"
Old Village,Excellent service and patience. Great tea tasting and education
Old Village,Friendly and nice ambience. Tasty teas.
Old Village,A nice place for drinking Good Puer Tea
Old Village,"Newly opened stall at Yishun selling KL-style pork noodle (猪肉粉). Well it's not too bad, although I was expecting a little more robust taste in the soup like what I used to have in Malaysia. Price wise, $3.50 a bowl is quite decent. However the queue is really long as there are many ordering bak kut teh (1 hour to finally get the food), unless you are really nearby Yishun otherwise not worth the trip to travel all the way."
Old Village,Queued 1 hr. Most customers ordering from the BKT menu. Soup is nice and lots of liao for $3.50. But very thirsty after that :(
Old Village,"Big love, taste of hometown, highly recommended:blue_heart:"
Old Village,
Old Village,"Yummy!!! If you like Malaysian style of dry noodles, you will love this place.  The noodles were cooked perfectly with lard, fried onions oil and dark soy sauce - absolutely delicious!  For $3, the amount of ingredients in the bowl of soup was overwhelming. They had meat balls, minced meat, sliced meat, pork liver and small intestines:thumbs_up_medium-light_skin_tone::thumbs_up_medium-light_skin_tone::thumbs_up_medium-light_skin_tone:"
Old Village,"Update, 1st time here since they reopen, the Q & order system is still the same, slow & not very organized! Ordered my favorite 猪肉粉but it is not as tasty as before, just not the same! The portion seems smaller & less ingredients even though the price has increased. Definitely not on my must-eat list anymore. The prata stall family is very very noisy, speaking too loud, so annoying, you just want to get out of there!  Before, This KL style pork noodle is very good, they even serve cut green Chilli padi, very close to what you get in KL. Surprise to see locals like the pork noodle too, prepare to Q for it!"
Old Village,"The line was 11 pax deep. 27 minutes from all the way back, to food on the table. A decent moving pace by me. Nonetheless you will have the odd impatient customer shouting out and rushing the owner.  Very good size portions for $2.50.  Soup base was average tasting. The addition of aromatics and pork lard could only help it along by so much. Unfair matchup to be compared to the likes of Sekee or even Peter's.  I particularly enjoyed the 干捞 noodle. An all so simple melody of lard, sambal and dark soy. A most satisfying bowl on its own, worthy the wait."
Old Village,"Ordered their Mixed Pork Noodles for $4.00. Got 3 slices of pork, 2 thinly sliced pieces of liver and 2 pieces of intestines. Even the lard was given after I requested.  Broth was very bland. The meat however was well cleaned and had no funky taste except the intestines had a slight bitter taste from the alkaline wash. Bee hoon was a good portion though. The star of the meal was their special green chilli sauce which was piquant and packed quite a bit of heat.  All in, nothing like what you will get in Malaysia for the same price, whether in terms of ingredients or taste."
Old Village,"Mixed Pork Kway Teow and Long Bean Pork Belly Rice. Opened by the same person who brought us old world bak kut teh. This stall is a venture to bring us KL style pork noodle at a low starting price of $2.50 (what!?). I opted for the mixed version which includes sliced pork, liver, meat balls and sweet intestines at $3 (yes what?!). While I have not gone all the way to KL for pork noodles, I had my share of pork noodles in JB pre-covid and because its in Malaysia, there is pig blood being offered there while none can be serve here.  The broth is a good sweet porky taste that has a strong hint of pepper and I encourage the dry version for the noodles will be lard laden and in the classic Malaysia black sauce. The long bean pork belly rice is not a lot to shout about but it takes me back to home style food where it can be good on its own. And at $1.50 for this bowl, I clearly overstuffed myself."
Fico,Food was excellent. Service was exceptional. Good recommendations by Service staff Dave. Genuinely friendly and helpful. And cheerful. Very impressed. Ambience was nice. Classy looking yet not too stiff. Very chill.
Fico,"Great food, great ambience! Jeremy was the best!"
Fico,"Fico is located at the best part of East Coast park. The beach front is not crowded and is besides the beautiful bougainvillea garden. Is the best place to bring pets. My dining experience at Fico is warm and memorable. Credit to the service crew and chefs. Special shout out to Ben Steven who has given us very good recommendations and advice with our food order. The fish that he recommended was superb. Joey who introduced the dessert to us was so good that we tried almost all on the menu. Chef Sam and Chef Yong were very friendly to explain and share with us each of our dishes. Nonetheless, they are all a bunch of nice happy people. Can’t wait to visit again."
Fico,"Slightly far flung but very pretty place to be.  Wish it was slightly cooler but it really gets nicer with the sea breeze once it’s nighttime.  Loved the pastas and each of them have such good flavours. Very honest food and no theatrics to mask the produce. Loved all the desserts too and liked how they popped next to your table in a trolley.  Would definitely need or come back to finish the menu.  Also, the toilet had a piped in dripping sound which was oddly therapeutic."
Fico,The service staff were superb in their attention to details and making us comfortable. It was truly enjoyable. In particular Arthiban was very welcoming and warm and knowledgeable. He convinced us to order the sea bream fish which was devoured in no time! The pastas and desserts were delicious! We will be back soon for sure!
Fico,"I cannot thank the manager, Caroline, enough for the fantastic dining experience at Fico. Securing a table here is no easy feat, but Caroline's exceptional assistance, passion to serve and dedication made it all possible. The staff is incredibly warm and welcoming. From the moment we arrived, they ensured everything ran smoothly, and their warm demeanor added a personal touch to our evening. The entire dining experience was made even more enjoyable with the delectable pastries made by Chef Angelina. I can't wait to return for another memorable meal. Highly recommended!"
Fico,"Amazing ambience and the food was delicious, worth every cent. Our favourite was the focaccia / 9” pizza, but honestly everything was yummy. The service staff were so attentive and professional as well. Definitely coming back here for special occasions or date nights :-)"

Everything was crispy, super affordable and sauces were all good! My fav has got to be the zai er, perfect crisp with sweet sauce. Enoki with pork belly was super worth it and enoki was crisp, not too much batter. Yums! Came ard 1am and service was very quick."
DLLM Lok Lok,"Each stick is prized at only $1! Loved the marinate and the sauces for their lok loks as well! Truly an amazing place to come for supper!  They even sell Maggie bowls you can have to complement the lok loks.  Though if you are coming, beware that the queues can get really long and you have to wait a substantial time if it happens"
DLLM Lok Lok,Cannot complain. $1 one stick and quite nice some more. Go where and find. Beer not included. But goes well with it :face_with_tears_of_joy:
DLLM Lok Lok,"This is inside Seng Huat Food Street coffeeshop. It's hard to miss it since their food display is quite prominent. Not easy to reach here.  Min order is 5sticks, and it goes for 1stick $1. Quite a few variety here.  You put on the plastic disposable gloves to choose your sticks using the metal tray, before bringing it to the counter to make payment.  They have quite a few Chilli sauces for you to self service. They even have salted Egg Yolk sauce which is absolutely sinful but delicious.  The sticks you choose will be fried and sprinkled with black sweet sauce and some Chilli powder.  They accept paynow/paylah/visa/Mastercard here.  They only sell maggi Mee for carbs here. I ordered the Yang Zhou fried rice at the zi Char stall beside to go with the lokloks.  Had a fulfilling dinner."
DLLM Lok Lok,"A far away place. A few customers on a Thursday 9ish night. The selection was ok, not too bad. Fried to just nice. A bit oily though."
DLLM Lok Lok,"Damn efficient! Lucky we came on weekday and was served very quickly! Love the salted egg sauce that goes perfectly with the sticks! Love that it’s not too oily too. I like the mee too! Was cooked to the perfect texture, not soggy at all."
DLLM Lok Lok,"Affordable place to grab supper, the location is tucked away in a secluded corner in the west.  Was impressed with the food quality and ambience.  Indeed a hidden gem worth visiting!"
DLLM Lok Lok,"Enjoyed our meal very much. Food taste yummy, not too spicy for kids and they have a wide variety, food is fresh. Many different types of sauces for dipping too!  Ordered 2 rounds Each stick is $1 no GST or service charge! And the wet wipe so cute!"
DLLM Lok Lok,"$1 per stick, decent price, the pork belly enoki has 2 per stick which is ok, the tomyum noodles very spicy but I love it. The sauce spread on the loklok is prolly on a more salty side but is fine. 2nd time back here."
Golden Nur,First time trying despite being in the area for long. Colleague recommended this stall and I must say it’s impressive. At least for this dish that I tried. The meat is soft and tender. I like the crispy bits that adds texture to the dish. And the curry gravy is not too stingy
Golden Nur,"Wifey and I had talked about visiting the Market Street Hawker Centre since their re-opening at the Capitaspring Skyscraper. Eventually, we made the trip this morning.  Had intentionally planned to arrive before the lunch peak hours. At 10:40am, the Hawker Centre wasn’t crowded.  Took a stroll around the stalls located at levels 2 & 3.  Finally, we decided to eat at Level 3 and I selected the Mutton Briyani (felt like eating briyani today) from Golden Nur Nasi Briyani and Crispy Chicken Rice stall.  When I got the plate of Nasi Briyani piled up with briyani rice, I asked the Stall Holder, “Where’s the mutton?” And he told me it’s inside the rice pile.  When I “dug into” the rice, to my disappointment, there was only a rather small piece of mutton. But lots of achar, and deep fried tasteless flour stuff  (which I thought they were some kind of sambal initially). And a bowl of rather diluted curry. The achar wasn’t special at all, wasn’t appetizing.  Wifey was telling me, “Hey, mutton is expensive nowadays you know?”  Come on …. for $7, surely the stall can serve a bigger portion of meat!  And the mutton wasn’t done well, pretty dry. Tend to think it was leftover from yesterday’s unsold.  It was a bad start of the day and my first visit and first order from this Hawker Centre. So disappointing!"
Golden Nur,"It is freaaaaking shiok! The briyani is light but super delicious. Even after I ate all the rice, I don’t feel as heavy vs other briyani meals. Highly recommended. Just go for the crispy chicken briyani. It comes with some curry sauce on the side."
Golden Nur,I think the hype for this place is slightly high but personally the briyani taste very average. Must say it's unique that they serve the fried chicken with fried crunchy bits on the side. The side of Cucumber and pineapple pickle was a good touch.
Golden Nur,Always a pleasure having crispy chicken biryani here.  Recipe and taste remains the same all these years.  The rice is not overly spiced.  Serving size is filling and worth the price.  Curry sauce really compliments this dish.  Staff is good and efficient.  Good place to take anyone who wants a 1st time biryani experience.
Honbo,"Simply amazing and downright hearty burgers. It leans towards the pricier side for sure, but I think the quality more than justifies the price tag. Buns were golden and fluffy, firm enough to hold up all the ingredients while soaking up all the sauces and juices. We had the Honbo 2.0 that came with 4 crispy patties, and of course it was a touch salty (3 slices of cheese and 4 patties here), but every component was well executed and I’d dare say this is the best smashed patty I’ve had. The Gold Standard’s more balanced with thicker, juicier patties and crisp fresh onions to cut through all those rich flavours — perfect for those wanting a classic, hearty burger. The staff were also all really friendly and smiley, made us feel super welcomed!"
Honbo,"Love the authentic crafted burger! The patty had its own depth of favour and you can tell it’s freshly made as it’s not pre-flattened like others. The pun is interesting, fluffy and complimented well with the patty. Also the hot sauce is so good! Will definitely go back if I craft for burger!"
Honbo,Newly opened! There were many empty tables with reservations on it with no actual bookings. It seems like they are just  maintaining a queue outside the place.  The orders was processed quickly and burgers was served. The gold standard burger was the best tasting. The Honbo 1.5 was a little salty. Over all the burgers were ok.  Will come back again when the craze dies down and I should have a better dinning experience.
Honbo,The patty itself was nice. But the burger as a whole was quite salty. Not sure if the patty was over seasoned or because of the sauce + salt in patty. Overall very 1 dimensional in flavour. And steep price point.
Honbo,"Cheese burger was okay.  Service was good, although there was only 1 person taking orders.  Scallop burger was just scallops and parsley inside. The scallops are frozen ones, with a bit of mashed texture and whitish colour inside.  The bread they used for their burgers are different from the common types of bread used for burgers in Singapore.  Overall, I feel it's not worth due to the expensive price."
Tasty Thai,"Amazing clear tom yum soup, mango salad & Thai basil rice. Probably the best Tom yum soup I’ve ever tried. It’s spicy, light texture but complex in flavour. The portion is good, reasonable price, friendly Thai owner. Second time buying & definitely come more often to try other items. Highly recommend!!!  P/S: to the owner: thank you for your amazing food. It was a nice talking to you. I really impressed by your hard work and putting heart in your cooking. The food speaks for itself. I hope you get more business, keep up with your work & dreams. You deserve it!!!"
Tasty Thai,"Tom Yum Soup is to die for. Looks meh, but one sip and the heavens will shine through yr soul. Thai basil rice hits spots you've never known you had. Starts off mild. Thought it could been a tad bit spicier. By the end of the dish, my mouth had visited the realms of hell. Very deceiving, very authentic. MUST TRY!"
Tasty Thai,"Wanted to try this new stall but the seller wasn’t friendly when I enquired him about a certain dish, as if I was wasting his time, so I patronised other stalls instead. Maybe I’ll come back when he is less busy."
Tasty Thai,Super authentic and great Thai food. Must try!
Tasty Thai,Was there for dinner on a Saturday dinner. The food price is reasonable and tasty.
Tasty Thai,Yummy for tummy! - Moo Ping is a must! - Pork noodle/ boat noodle is good rich taste - Chicken green curry full flavour - Tasty Thai Ice-tea that not too sweet which I love!  Highly recommended 
Tasty Thai,"Nice, affordable thai food. Moo ping is good!"
Tasty Thai,"As a Thai, this shop serves very authentic flavor food. My favorites are boat noodle and green curry chicken (ask for less spicy option)"
Tasty Thai,"I’m so surprised by this stall! Me and my friend didn’t expect to have such an affordable yet authentic Thai food in the CBD. the Boat Noodle, MooPing and Green Curry Chicken are a must-try!!  We will definitely go back there again!!"
Tasty Thai,I like their MooPing (Grilled Pork Skewer). Will be getting their MooPing with rice in my next visit
Tasty Thai,"Super yummy authentic Thai food! Stew pork legs and Thai style fish is my favourite. The environment is cozy , suitable for family dinner, friends gathering who love Thai food.  The dessert water chestnuts are sweet and yummy. Feel like I am in Thai Bangkok street!"
Tasty Thai,"Authentic thai food at Bukit Rimau, Kota Kemuning. They provide the good service and fast. The thai food is authentic and tasty, especially the Tom Yam and Seafood Fried Rice. I was at the restaurant during dinner time and i was full house. So, have to go early to avoid lesser waiting time for table. Price are reasonable at the area."
Tasty Thai,"Went in Thu night and it was full! Boss a young Chinese man with a tattoo firearm, was very pleasant and quietly, showed us to a reserved table, allow us to sit to wait for a table to clear. We ordered. And our assigned table is vacated. We sat there and in a short while, our food appeared. The green curry pork is tasty, rich, and just right spiciness. Pandan Chicken aromatic. We brought our own prawns to add to their equally rich, thick creamy Tom Yam seafood soup. mango salad good, kangkong good. All in a satisfying meal. Price slightly on higher side but the food satisfies, if you like tasty, rich, thick soup and sauce."
Tasty Thai,"IG: iamcynditravel  Great food they provide. We ordered a few dishes and all are actually pretty good. We recommend. Just that the spacings are a little  tight. But it is still alright, a great place overall"
Tasty Thai,"-Location/Parking Technically located at Bukit Rimau but still considered part of Kota Kemuning. It's not a very busy place and you can get parking easily most of the time.  -Decor/Ambience Average decor, it has a homely and cosy vibe. Good for meals with friends or family.  -Food Food here is above average. the seasoning they use is quite authentic to Thai. Quantity and quality is worth the price and it's one of the rare good food places in Kota Kemuning.  -Service Fast, attentive and friendly. No complaints here.  -Final Thoughts Come here if you're craving for some home-cooked thai food that's equally affordable and delicious."
Tasty Thai,"Ordered their Thai pork trotter rice ($4.90) + Thai kway chap (also $4.90)! Pork trotter rice was served with preserved vegetable, braised egg and of course chunks of stewed pork leg. Meat was extremely tender with just the right amount of fats, and rice was drenched with fragrant braised sauce which was so flavoursome! The kway chap was very soft and had a silky mouthfeel, the broth was tasty and had some herbal taste in it. There's also multi slices of delicious pork belly and fish sausage. Also found some pork lard in it! Yum! This Thai eatery is really a gem and I will definitely come back for more."
Tasty Thai,"Had the Pork Trotter rice and the Thai Kway Chap. Both equally delicious and worth the money.  The trotter rice had a small portion of preserved veg and half an egg but the real star is the braised meat. Simply melts in your mouth and good value for $4.90.  If you don't like the peppery Kway Chap, you'll be pleasantly surprised by the Thai version. Comes with fish sausage (a crowd favorite), pig skin, meatballs (meh) and a herb-centric soup base. Would ask them to go easy on the pork lard as it doesn't bring too much to the dish.  We asked for it spicy and they delivered. If you aren't careful the first sip of soup will take your breath away.  Will definitely be back to try the intestines, knuckle and fried chicken."
Tasty Thai,"Ordered the thai pork trotter rice $4.90 and braised big intestine $5.  The braised herbal flavour in the trotter is abit mild and not salty because you're supposed to dipped it in the chilli fish sauce which will elevate the flavour, I would say that this is quite similar to the one that I have tried in one of my trip in Thailand.  The intestine is tender and does not have any smell, and the broth is fragrant and flavourful.  The doneness of the rice reminded me of kampung style rice haha, it's on the harder side which I think is quite nice to pair with the broth.  I would recommend if you're in the area!"
Tasty Thai,"Intestine is well cleaned with a light braising broth. Good texture and well flavored. Kway Chap consists of various items such as pork belly, pork balls, fish balls and lard. The fish ball akin to a sausage was excellent, superb flavor and taste of umami. The kway, unlike the local version (broad sheet), was slightly firmer and small sized. The broth was light but tasty. Pork trotter rice. The salted vegetable was underwhelming, neither salty nor sweet. A half sized half boiled egg was average. An onsen egg would have stolen the ahow. The pork was leaner cut and of average taste. Friendly owner and service is quick"
Tasty Thai,"Went down on a Thursday evening. There are plenty of seats possibly due to several closed stalls in the same coffeeshop.  There is no queue which was odd since it was dinner time (6+pm). We ordered the Thai Kway Chap and Thai Pork Trotter Rice since both are Chef's recommendation on the menu.  Both personnel in the stall started preparing the dish once our order is placed. Food was ready in a few minutes (kway chap is cooked on the spot).  The herbal soup of the kway chap was just nice, not too salty and not too plain. The rolled Kway was firm and springy. Fish sausage is sweet and slightly savoury (like Taiwanese sausage). Meat ball is nice and have the pork taste while not having the overwhelming pork smell. Pig skin was cooked just right, not too firm and not soggy, and has a springy bite. All these comes together well and made the dish really great.  The pork trotter was really tender, it can almost melt in your mouth. The flavour of the meat was just nice and goes well with the chilli from the stall. The braised zhup poured on the rice was the watery type but gave the rice a nice flavour while not making the rice sticky and dry. Together with the pickled vegetable, the mix of flavour for this dish was really great as well.  Both dishes are great to eat on its own. At the price of $4.90 each, they are one of the really affordable and well down dish to have in this region. Would recommend to come down to try if you are in the west side of SG."
Tasty Thai,"Authentic Thai food experience located at Bukit Timah Hawker Centre. This hawker stall is operated single handedly by a Thai lady and serves up traditional Thai dishes like Tomyum soup, Basil chicken rice, pad Thai and glass noodles salad. You can add on noodles and rice to the tomyum soup if you wish. I order from this store frequently as the food served feel authentic and tastes consistently good."
Tasty Thai,My all time fav thai food when I was a student.
Tasty Thai,Extremely rude. Not worth coming at all. Food and ppl are worth less than 1 star
Tasty Thai,Delicious authentic Thai food!
Tasty Thai,Probably the best Thai food in Singapore
Tasty Thai,"Satisfied with my order on a cold night, the main were flavourful and very filling. Side dishes (fried midwing and salted vege) ordered were recommended. Must try the fried midwing:thumbs_up::thumbs_up::thumbs_up: stall personel were very attentive and offered me extra soup as I have lesser soup in my main. :winking_face::OK_hand::victory_hand:  Subsequent visit, the food is still good and flavourful. Order other side dishes (fried chicken, pig skin and taopok) have not really get anything that's awful.  Will be moving on to try other dishes if passing by."
Tasty Thai,Ordered Pig Trotter rice for lunch. The meat is tender and the gravy is on point. Overall a satisfying meal.
Tasty Thai,Very nice Pork Leg Rice and Mixed Pork Soup
Tasty Thai,"Try their pork trotter rice bowl. Taste was good and satisfying. Just wish the price could be better or make the serving portion bigger.  A rare Thai meal, the taste is OK. May come back to try other menus. The price is a bit on the high side and the portions are small. Kind of do not understand how to do business, pity."
Tasty Thai,Tasty Thai - Thai Kuey Sauce
Tasty Thai,"amazing pork trotter rice to get in town! i've tried every item from them and did not disappoint at all! my all time favourite will be their signature pork trotter rice and thai fried crispy pork! never try never know, do drop by when you drive/walk pass!"
Tasty Thai,
Tasty Thai,Very generous  portion and tasty!!!
Tasty Thai,
The Three Elephants,Braised pork trotter rice ($6.80) - Good. The pork was not too fat or too lean. The cilantro and piquant chilli sauce went well with it. The rice was moist and flavourful. Lemon sour plum ($2.30) - Rather diluted.
The Three Elephants,"The duck noodle is flavourful, rich in spies and herbs, generous in portion.   Very similar taste to that in Siam Square noodle shop.  Pork trotter rice is nice too.   Clean and comfortable environment."
The Three Elephants,"Never realised this little open concept restaurant at all until my colleague told me. There is no sign of it. if you are at the opposite road totally cannot see.. braised pig trotter have a variety of side, Kan Lan, mei cai mushroom and egg but the braised taste lack of a little flavour. chili used taste is a too strong n over power food"
The Three Elephants,Braised duck rice was not bad! I also liked the sour plum lemon drink. A very simple no-frills eatery where you pay and then collect your own food. Highly affordable.
The Three Elephants,Dapao the braised pork belly rice a few months ago when it first opened and it was not bad. Wanted to dine-in just now but decided not to patronise again after I saw that everything were served in disposables even for dining-in. :grinning_face_with_sweat:
Bismi Briyani,Delicious grilled chicken kabsa rice and friendly stall owner! Chicken bigger than my face and flavours were present and strong and memorable. Will come again to try the other menu options!
Bismi Briyani,"Mixed experience for me.Ordered Chicken Briyani. The rice is dry and the flavour is not per my liking. 6/10. The chicken on the other hand is well marinated and full of flavour, meat is soft and tender, sambal is spicy and potent. 9/10."
Bismi Briyani,"Not the first time I ate the lamb shank here, it’s still worth it despite the price rise. This time round, was given a small bowl of kambing soup and that really paired well! Not too gamey meal at all. Be careful with the green chilli, it really packs a punch.  The platter price increased to $36 but I think it’s quite a good deal. Just need to find 3 friends to share it with. :smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes:"
Bismi Briyani,"Best nasi biryani i’ve had in my life! My mum said the same thing and she’s over 50! The lamb shank is so soft, you only need a fork to pull it apart. We got a second piece. The kabsa rice is so amazingly flavourful, every bite was a mmm from us. We shared between 3 but this will be good for 4 on average."
Bismi Briyani,I got the lamb chop briyani. That’s the closest thing to mutton briyani they have. I was expecting a big piece of meat with half of it consisting of bone. It turns out the bone was only 10% of it while the meat was fall off the bone tender. Rice could have been more flavourful as I kept having to pour gravy over it to make it palatable.
Abang Curry,"Gonna give 5 stars because they separated the sauce to prevent takeaways getting soggy. ordered the crispy chicken rice. salad is nice. rice big portion. curry is perfect. the batter is great. currypuff is good (prefer this to OCK). They sell 3 types of Curry puffs: sardine, curry chicken and curry potato. gonna try the other two next time. price point is good for the quality and quantity. Service is good too. Please keep it up!"
Abang Curry,"Small and superb menu, can try all items available here. Quality and quantity of the food is good. Staff is friendly and waiting time is 5-10 minutes. We tried Panko Otah Rice, Fish with Bread was deep fried and served with rice and curry. There was a red & green chili paste provided as a sauce, it was superb spicy. Will recommend everyone to try their menu."
Abang Curry,heard of this outlet thru fb and wanted to  go to their bedok outlet to try but sadly its permanently closed. nevertheless i headed down to their other outlet in west (JEM) and oh boy it was worth the trip. the food is really good especially the panko chicken not to mention portion size is quite fulling for me . chicken is easy to cut and the panko batter tasted fresh. wouldn’t mind coming back here again
Abang Curry,"Had their Panko Chicken Rice and Charcoal Grilled Chicken and Salmon Rice. Love their Nanyang Curry sauce, it was fragrant and flavourful and mildly spicy. Panko Chicken is crispy and their charcoal grilled has crispy-skin salmon and smokey and juicy chicken thigh meat. Great comfort food."
Abang Curry,"Visited their JEM outlet a while back. Had the Panko Chicken and Grilled Chicken and Salmon. Super rich curry sauce over rice, tender meats as well! Their curry puffs were also well filled with generous amounts of chicken and potato :)"
Breakfast Club,"3.5 stars food portion is large if you are a small eater. Food looks really good for picture so if you are looking to take some videos or photos to show your friends, this is the place to get good looking food on your social posts for affordable prices. All in all, the egg Benedict is only so so."
Breakfast Club,"The food here is first class in a coffeeshop. Well done for the hashbrowns , tater tots and bacon strips! They should consider changing the sausage to cheese instead of pepper. Mushrooms and scrambled eggs are on point definitely :thumbs_up_light_skin_tone:! Next on are the eggs benedict, eggs didn’t flow too much as eggs are small but overall still good, better than some brunch places i must say. Need to self serve and carry your own food. Worth a visit for brunch!"
Breakfast Club,"Love the generous portions for the price! Rosti was perfectly crispy, my favourite dish. We shared the Breakfast Plate+ ($11.90), Rosti with Sausage & Egg & Bacon ($11.90) and Potato Salad ($2.50 add on) amongst 4 people and was full enough. The store is in a coffee shop with other interesting stores like bingsu dessert, chilli pan mee."
Breakfast Club,"Visited on a Saturday morning. Located in a corner coffeeshop overlooking the main road, it is very accessible. Food was good, i’m surprised the rosti is well seasoned. Can’t go wrong with sausages. Will be back for the breakfast platter! But service was mid… and there’s no option for paylah/paynow only cash or nets so do come prepared."
Breakfast Club,"Had their rosti awhile ago, and tried their chicken chop this time. Really consistently good quality food and the fries were amazing. Free flow maple syrup is never an issue. Love them!"
Breakfast Club,"Amazing experience under Jacinda and her dedicated team’s great hospitality. The ambience is so surreal , definitely bring me back to Hogwarts! The breakfast club has great meaning behind their brand. I am always amazed by how create they can get with such pure toxin free vegan food :relieved_face: I am looking forward to dine in for lunch soon!"
Breakfast Club,"Enjoyed the comforting and healthy vegan meal that's been sincerely prepared by the hosts. Most of the ingredients used were organic and/or homegrown and they taste really good without the use of any artificial flavourings. I especially loved the curry, the salad & tropical fruit bowl with homemade peanut dressing, and the chickpea tofu!  The space itself is super cozy and stress-relieving too. There's a couple dining spaces next to a long stretch of window with views of the trees outside. Come with friends, or come alone. Either way it's great for both the mind and body!"
Breakfast Club,"Attended their Harry Potter special event. Love the place and the host/chef was amazing, esp w her sharing. Would love to come by again. And of course food was great and really comforting. Thank you girls!!!"
Breakfast Club,"Since young, I've always been a picky eater and had trouble finishing my food -- happy to report that I finished every single bite at The Breakfast Club!  I never knew vegan food can be this yummy.  The main dish, wholegrain rice + avocado + mango salsa + dragon fruit + black beans + tofu + peanut sauce, was delicious. Same goes to the side dish (papaya rice cracker)! The dessert, a chocolate banana ice cream, left me wanting more. I'm still having trouble believing that it has no sugar.  Jacinda's an incredible host. She's welcoming, gracious, and a bundle of sunshine. Thank you for sharing your story with me! :smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes: I'll definitely be back for more."
Breakfast Club,"I have come across The Breakfast club on social media about a year ago. Ever since first setting foot in Jacinda’s home and experiencing her amazing hospitality and cooking, I have been returning to take in more of this truly unique experience in Singapore. Besides the great food and vibes I have also become friends with many folks in the greater Breakfast Club community and I wish you all get a chance to try her food and get taken by the whole experience just like I am."
Apollo Coffee Bar,"𝗣𝗼𝗿𝘁𝗼 𝗙𝗿𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲𝘀𝗶𝗻𝗵𝗮 ($25.90) :cut_of_meat::cooking::cheese_wedge: This was a massive meat monster with mad visuals and we knew we had to get it. A chicken sausage patty, spam slice, and steak were sandwiched between toasted focaccia and topped with a gooey emmental cheese and a fried egg, sitting in a pool of orange sauce. While this was visually stunning, the taste fell short once you look at the individual components. The sausage patty and spam tasted were underwhelming while the steak was thin, well-done and carried only a mild beefy flavour. We also couldn’t make out what the sauce was supposed to taste like, but yet it was necessary as it would be too dry without it. This was filling but pricey and we probably wouldn’t get this again.  𝗖𝗮𝗿𝗯𝗼𝗻𝗮𝗿𝗮 ($22.20) :spaghetti::cheese_wedge: The sample picture for this showed a bowl of creamy carbonara with a runny egg yolk in the center, covered by an tempting layer of shaved parm and it looked TOO GOOD not to order! Luckily we got this to share, because their sauce is made with cream and got surfeiting real fast. While it was delicious and they were generous with the bacon and shimeji, it would be difficult to finish this on your own. Not bad though!  𝗪𝗮𝗴𝘆𝘂 𝗕𝗲𝗲𝗳 𝗕𝘂𝗿𝗴𝗲𝗿 𝘄 𝗖𝘂𝗿𝗹𝘆 𝗙𝗿𝗶𝗲𝘀 ($22.70) :hamburger::french_fries: Our friend had this and enjoyed this burger greatly, we stole some fries (which everyone agreed tasted exactly like macs curly fries) which were crispy and seasoned. The burger bun was fluffy and toasted and the patty was juicy. A classic burger that can’t go wrong.  𝗖𝗵𝗶𝗮 𝗽𝘂𝗱𝗱𝗶𝗻𝗴 & 𝗬𝗼𝗴𝗵𝘂𝗿𝘁 :custard::honey_pot::ice_cream: Can’t remember how much this was but our friend that had it said it was “so gooooood” & they seemed really generous with the toppings (esp the glistening nut butter)  Do make a reservation beforehand as Apollo gets extremely crowded on weekends. Food wise, it was typical cafe food and we weren’t super blown away. The servings were generous but we did find it kinda pricey :/  Follow us on IG @toofoodtomiss for more foodie content!"
Apollo Coffee Bar,I am in love with their potato tots ! So flavourful without any sauce. The beef of the don and with the mashed cauliflower just melted into the mouth. Unagi and the omelette was abit too sweet and couldn’t finish them all. Fresh ingredients and good coffee.  There are many interesting dishes to try next time however one thing I realy wanna try was their risotto yet they aren’t serving anymore :(
Apollo Coffee Bar,"very pleasant atmosphere, which is ideal for catch-up or getting work done!! this place is definitely on the pricier side, but i’d say it is one of the better tasting cafes.  i rly loved the matcha, which was on the sweeter side! :teacup_without_handle: the matcha is slightly sweeter & the milk does not overpower it’s fragrance :). 4.5/5. their kyoho grape house soda was rly pleasant & refreshing as well, but at a whopping ~$8 :face_with_spiral_eyes: i don’t know if it’s worth it. perhaps you could recreate it by crabonating pokka’s kyoho grape drink. 3/5. their pistachio cake tasted like a dense block of butter batter, your mother could bake. very sweet & does get a bit overwhelming… 2.5/5. their carbonara could be shared by two as it does get quite gelak. but the noodles were perfectly al dante! (my grandmother loved it haha she said it was very ‘Q’) 3.5/5. can try!!! i think it tasted really good, jus toooooo thick i got a bit sick of it :face_with_spiral_eyes:. chicken bbang bbang noodles had a kick of spice! :hot_pepper: the noodles were also very ‘Q’ & chewy :) which i liked. the chicken was well-seasoned & cooked as well. the dish’s components really complemented each other. 4/5. the wagyu cheeseburger tasted like a decent cheeseburger, just that it costs ~$25 :face_with_crossed-out_eyes:. 3/5."
Apollo Coffee Bar,"Tldr: the only nice the we ate when we visit was the chicken wings. No kidding  Went to this place at serangoon garden. Choose an interesting drink for my guess the drink quiz on twitter, then ordered some food. Sunday’s Ragu was pretty normal. Beef don wasnt good (according to my friend) but man, the spicy wings are good. The wings itself is crispy, and the sauce is liken to sour Tabasco sauce. The mix is so good, i wanted to order another one (if not for the price) Overall, its an experience, but i won’t return here."
Apollo Coffee Bar,"Coffee, waffles and fries were good! The textures and tastes of the candied bacon waffle was particularly impressive, I really enjoyed it. The cereal prawn pasta was also a very interesting spin on the local hawker fare, while it could have used more flavour, but was a nice idea."
Lee's Confectionery,"Bliss..... Fleeting.... Nuanced refined... Not wow heavy but just simply easy yet trickle to the buds..  The pastry is the reason to come. My pistachio cream orange cake looks nothing like it but beautifully presented. Just like a pistachio nut.  Not just the delicate artistic pastry designs but taste wonderfully crafted. Its not really about powerful strong intense flavors. But carefully crafted mixture of flavours that goes very well as a whole. Not about balance, but a well infusion of different but excellent textures and flavors yet in a very refined way.  Even the choice of coffee beans goes well with it. Not those strong, intense punchy nutty  but wonderfully mildly acidic flavorful balanced coffee. Goes very well with the cakes.  Even the decor is made to be simple white yet cosy to give complement to the focus on pastries..  A pleasant refined experience... Great for high tea types :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes:"
Lee's Confectionery,"I had been going on a tart craze for more than a year. This is the first place that actually serve their tart with plating! Presentation-wise, they do so much better than most patisseries, including the Michelin-starred ones. Everything they do, from their desserts to their drinks are done with class and elegance. They serve their food with thoughts and pride. Thumbs up!"
Lee's Confectionery,"6 options available and 4 of them are seasonal items. The seasonal items change every three months. The cakes were so good, I would want to go back and try their new seasonal items.  Total bill came up to be $33 for 2 cakes and 2 drinks. Highly recommend MADU"
Lee's Confectionery,This place is a hidden Jem and has the best desserts (not overtly sweet!). Coffee has rich taste and aroma!
Lee's Confectionery,Understated patisserie and cafe in Jurong that is definitely worth the visit. I enjoyed the pistachio desert a lot and it pairs well with the coffee. Cafe has a minimalist design that is pleasing.
Pilcrow,"It's a must visit as everything is so so gorgeous! From the pastel coloured decor to the view of the river to the beautifully plated desserts, my eyes are in for a treat.  Their Strawberry & Pistachio Mille Feuille was so delicious! Creamy pistachio paired with crispy puffy pastry plus sweetness from the fruits & mixed berries sorbet. The staffs are so welcoming & friendly, thanks Joseph, Suzanne & Jes for the excellent service!"
Pilcrow,"Beautifully plated, their Exotique (plated dessert) was refreshing, not too sweet and had a harmony of flavours. The Pit Of The Plum cocktail pairs really well and was surprisingly good! Check this out if you’re in the area and looking for a nice dessert place to chill over drinks after dinner…"
Pilcrow,"I've just had the Greatest wings of all time... Crispy, hot delicious and you can choose your spice level. To me, they rivalled The Cheesecake Factory wings.. and that's the benchmark for me! We also got happy hour at 9pm on a public holiday. These guys are awesome. Thankyou!"
Pilcrow,"It’s almost essential to always save room for desserts! :face_savoring_food: After our Vietnamese dinner at Boat Quay, we decided to chill and enjoy some exquisite plated dessert and cocktail by the riverside.  @pilcrow is a laid-back, cosy dessert bar that has both indoor and outdoor seats. It’s a perfect location for some me time or for a small gathering with your closest friends. Zayn was complaining about my choice of the outdoor seat, but such beautiful dessert and cocktail just have to go with the relaxing view and soothing night breeze isn’t it! :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing:  :strawberry: Strawberry & Pistachio Mille Feuille The fragrant and nutty pistachio creme makes a perfect combi with the sweet strawberries and mangos. Together with the crispy pastry and strawberry sorbet, it is a match made in heaven indeed.  :cocktail_glass: Pit of the Plum Cocktail A unique and handcrafted cocktail made with plum spirit, grapefruit and yuzu. All the flavors I love and it isn’t too strong in its alcohol content. It’s such a refreshing pairing with the dessert which we truly enjoy."
Pilcrow,"A chilled relaxed evening at @pilcrowsg, a progressive dessert bar, indulging in their bold, plated desserts created for the local palate and made in-house. These creations are handcrafted with a modern approach.  Each plate is paired with a serving of sorbet and our drinks are best paired with a dessert.  Sweetest season with the christmassy festive vibes coming and enjoy the moment by the riverside.  If you are craving an ice-cold beer, it's especially welcoming in the lovely ambience.  Thank you @shirz.t and @scalemicroinfluencers for the invitation, along with @jo_keting."
Yi Qian Ling Yi Ye Steamboat Buffet,"Service is alright, the lady who sat us was very friendly to us even though they seemed very busy. Food was okay, not amazing but not terrible, and they arrived really quickly.  The set-up is hilariously cramped, and the BBQ set-up is just a small portable grill set haphazardly on the non-working conveyer belt infront of the table.  Overall an alright place :) experience was made better by friendly lady"
Yi Qian Ling Yi Ye Steamboat Buffet,"Use eatigo 50% off but need to top up $3 for compulsory BBQ and also gst and service charge end up total is $17.  For lunch buffet, seafood menu can't order so just whack the meat item got beef, pork and chicken. Also got drinks, ice cream included in the buffet.  I won't say it's super good but also not super bad cos you are just paying $17 in the air con shopping mall. Will go again if I ever feel like doing so"
Yi Qian Ling Yi Ye Steamboat Buffet,"The worst steam boat I ever eat. The food is not fresh, the hygiene not good, the drinks very strange color and strange taste. Everything make me feel very regret to choose sit down here."
Yi Qian Ling Yi Ye Steamboat Buffet,Best all you can eat hotpot restaurant in terms of price and service I would say. The lady is so nice to us and even after we exceed the timing she never rush us because it was chinese new year. The price is also very friendly and the meats are fresh. Their soup was also very delicious and spicy which I personally love it so much. Will definitely make it my permanent hotpot place for gathering. Really love the experience here:smiling_face_with_heart-eyes::red_envelope:
Yi Qian Ling Yi Ye Steamboat Buffet,"the food buffet was actually great BUT we used eatigo to book for the discounted price but the staff told us it’s not worth as compared to the the original price (as this includes BBQ) while eatigo does not include u have to top up $3 on top of the discounted price. not only that they were super short staffed, 2 waitress serving on the floor and they were running around mad crazy. we had 3 pax, one of the server put us at the corner with 1 little bbq counter literally the size of a book that kids would read for the 3 of us!?!!! they expect us to pay for bbq but only give us one small bbq counter and one person has to cook for 3 of us in that small bbq counter?? carbonated drinks and another machine all ran out yes literally ran out coke? more like carbonated water even their ice machine was slow and barely had ice. maybe it was mother’s day but i don’t see why their management did not plan this through… their paywave machine was down as well…. overall the bbq and steamboat items was good but the cooked food (man tou…. rice… ice cream..) all were unavailable probably cause they didn’t have enough people to cook and replenish, and for rice they didn’t have any grains like ?? you’re a buffet place how can you run out of rice? went there a few times i would say this was the time that we all were super disappointed with the whole meal experience…. everything felt hectic and rushed with people constantly walking behind you as well"
Jyu Gae Bistro,"Food served is tasty, price is reasonable, many varieties from the Chinese (Taiwanese) cuisine available. Not that crowded on Sunday night, we did not have to make reservations. Walked in and were seated in no time. The 3 bowls signature set is worth to order. Live band singing is superb, acoustics and singers are wonderful. Audience was invited to up on stage to sing. Great atmosphere, will go back again"
Jyu Gae Bistro,Outdoor is crowded hot and noisy. Patrons practically talking at the top of their lungs. Signature 3 bowl set is overpriced and tasted terrible. The braised pork set is of poor quality. Didn't taste anything like taiwanese lurou fan. The beef noodles was the best amongst the 3 main meals we ordered. The taiwanese ham cheese egg crepe also overpriced and  tasted so so only. The passion fruit tea with pearl is just a bland cordial drink. Will not come again.
Jyu Gae Bistro,I visited this place before and introduced my friend to catch the liveband performance so I made reservation for table of 3 and arrived before the stated time.I was greeted by Irene at the entrance and she mentioned that my seating initially was arranged at the outdoor section however there was a vacant table available indoors and she allocated us to that table.We asked to be reassigned with another table as we did not want to be seated in front of the stage. Erica assisted us and we managed to be seated near the bar. Irene and Erica are patient and approachable. The food is freshly cooked and served hot and promptly. The ambience is good and the performers can really sing.Keep up the good customer service.
Jyu Gae Bistro,"Chillax. Nice ambience. Taiwanese food. Got live band on some days. Milk tea is nice. Their pork related dishes are meh... Thr pork stench was strong. The food itself is wondeful. It the stench that make it not up to standard. Other than that, we pretty much enjoy the food here. Deep fried feast I guess. Sakura Prawn, Ham Cheese Egg Crepe, fried oyster, Mee Sua recommended."
Jyu Gae Bistro,Nice ambience and delicious food (snacks a lil salty but addictive). Bilingual band with awesome song choices. Recommended to make reservations as indoor seats are hard to get when walk-in.
B For Bagel,the bacon cheese omelette bagel and beef goulash are not bad. my friend changed the bagel to onion for additional $1. menu is quite small in my opinion.  i would prefer more options (type of bagel & ingredient types) instead. 3/5 for pretty decent coffee and seats on a PH. :) ambience is not bad for conversations.
B For Bagel,"Basic bagel. Tad dry and not dense as you’d typically expect of a bagel so I’m not a fan but the chutney in the ham bagel I ordered was tasty. The design of the menu board and store has a nice, American diner inspiration though so gives the place a chill vibe."
B For Bagel,"Visited on a Sunday afternoon and cafe wasn’t too busy so we didn’t have to wait for seats.  What I ordered: Ham and Fig Chutney Bagel ($12.50) Bulgogi Beef Bagel ($15.90) Green Grape & Lime Ade ($6.50) Beef Goulash ($6.20)  Both bagels were toasted so that gave it a really crispy outer shell which was what I really liked. Given the slightly high prices, the fillings were of good quality and substantial.  Overall, this satisfied my bagel craving and will definitely visit again if I’m in the area though not too often because of the price point! This is worth a visit if you’re looking for great bagels in Singapore."
B For Bagel,"Crowded at brunch time, we were lucky to get a seat when we got there but very soon there was queue with seats all taken up.  Bagels were warm and soft, with a variety of fillings, sweet and savoury options. Decent, better than Two Men Bagels in the sense that it's less oily. Self-service concept, order and pay at the counter and collect your order when the buzzer sounds."
B For Bagel,"Bagels were okay, and the small tubs of flavoured cream cheese add-ons costs $4+ (I’d skip that). Coffees were decent. Staff was nice and really helpful with recommendations. Ventilation isn’t the best, and you leave carrying a smokey smell of fried food."
Supreme Ramen Xiao Long Bao,"Stall name changed to 美味拉面小笼包，dont know got change boss or not.  I have had much better beef noodles at other places, so my expectations are pretty high. Nevertheless, this bowl of chinese beef noodles ($5.50) is quite decent.  You can eat here if you fancy chinese beef noodles"
Supreme Ramen Xiao Long Bao,"Good value for money, and pretty delicious! The XLB are really good, skin is not too thick nor thin, and very soupy. The 红油抄手 (that dish in chilli oil) is also tasty without being overwhelmingly spicy. Noodles are alright and affordable, though the meats inside are a tad salty. I'll definitely return for the dumplings!"
Supreme Ramen Xiao Long Bao,"Tried their 抄手面 a couple of times, and it tasted delicious both times. For $4, the serving size is acceptable. The noodles have a nice bite to them and the dumplings have generous filling. I went on a weekday before 12:30pm and the crowd/ queue was not too bad."
Supreme Ramen Xiao Long Bao,"Very good xiao long bao at a fraction of the price that you get at Crystal Jade or Din Tai Fung. I would give it a 5 star if the skin can be even thinner. The menu is very intensive, and if you dont feel like xiao long bao I highly recommend the noodle with minced meat sauce. It's highly addictive. Can be very crowded during lunch."
Supreme Ramen Xiao Long Bao,"Went there alone at around 1.45pm based on a recommendation somewhere. Ordered dumpling ramen for $4.  Noodles was smooth and soft to eat. Soup have some taste to it. Vegetables seems fresh and soft to bite on. Vege is nice to eat.  Dumpling is stated to be frozen. Not so lively but the inner toppings is nice and flavourful.  Ginger is fine. Light coloured chili sauce is a bit spicy but it is still manageable for me. Dark coloured chili sauce is nice, not really spicy and good with the dumplings.  Overall, the dish does not shout out but one thing for sure is that the standard of this shop follows their restaurant work in the past which demonstrates a level of consistency in the food. To me, this place is a strong level 7/10 stall in the street food category."
Xiang Gang Xin Kou Wei,Very authentic hk dim sum with a very long history of food business branding. The dim sum are very yummy and reasonably priced. Especially their charsiew bun and porridge. Sweet and soft buns and smooth thick porridge. Easily one of the best in the east. But they only open on Saturdays and Sundays and Public Holidays though which is pity. Maybe it is due to lack of manpower.
Xiang Gang Xin Kou Wei,Simple Dim Sum in a neighbourhood industrial kopitiam busy within walking distance to Paya Lebar MRT.  This place is only open during Weekends and PH.  Taste wise is acceptable! Porridge taste good!
Xiang Gang Xin Kou Wei,"Food was alright, fresh but slightly salty for some dishes. Can consider if u r craving for dim sum.  What to look out for is their service. They added an extra dish into our order and say it was an mistake, but charge us the dish as well. We are fine with the extra dish, manage to finish it, but it felt like an dishonest approach to doing business.  When I voice out, they say it wasn't charge but it was. We let it slide since it only $4.50.  Make sure to keep ur receipt to counter check. Voice out if needed.  First and last time coming."
Xiang Gang Xin Kou Wei,"Went on sunday, open not very crowded. (Wait abt 15-20 for the food after ordering) Dim sum taste good and value for money. Love the mushroom chicken rice with plum vegetables, very tasty and tender chicken. Really taste good when serve hot, but since its an open air, food get cold quickly. So feast in once your dim sum arrives! Even though its menu not very extensive, the “core” dimsum (Char Siew Bao, Siew Mai, Har Gao, Ji cheong fan, etc) are there, which is good enough."
Xiang Gang Xin Kou Wei,"Humble selections, nostalgic dim sums.  Simple little stall that opens only on the weekends."
Xiang Gang Xin Kou Wei,"Came at 10 plus in the morning on a weekday and no queue! Ordered the prawn cheong fun for $5. Texture was soft and silky but sauce was a little sweet, lacking umami. Decent."
Xiang Gang Xin Kou Wei,Tasty chee cheong fan (ccf) freshly made ala-minute. Love the texture of the ccf. Overall one of the better ccf in SG.. worth a try!  Service is warm and prompt.
Xiang Gang Xin Kou Wei,Dropped by here on a Sunday to take away plain Chee Chong fun for my kiddo. Queued for close to 15 mins. They cleared the queue pretty fast. Really fresh and good. Is an art to see them making them on the spot. The sauce are separately packed and sealed properly which doesn’t spilled.
Xiang Gang Xin Kou Wei,"We got the prawn for takeaway, ccf is silky and entirely slurp-able. Sauce is salty with a tinge of sweetness. One portion has 8 prawns and is $5 (add $0.30 for takeaway container)  Lady who took our order has great memory and remembers who made which order even though everyone was sitting around waiting for their ccf."
Xiang Gang Xin Kou Wei,"Scallop cheong fun ($6) - 3.75 stars Good texture, though a bit thick. Soy sauce is too sweet. Chili is good. Scallops are succulent."
Xiang Gang Xin Kou Wei,"I knew I had to try this stall when I saw they only had Chee Cheong Fun and some side dishes. Yeah, the Chee Cheong Fun was chewy and packed with ingredients. Additionally, there's a wide selection of fillings. You should also try the chicken feet, which were juicy and plump, and the carrot cake, which was nicely fried. It's a little pricey, but understandable since it's a specialized stall."
Xiang Gang Xin Kou Wei,"Honestly the best cheong fun I've ever had :exploding_head: it was incredibly silky soft and I noticed that the chef steamed it traditionally by lining a tray with a wet cotton steaming cloth. Highly recommend this place before catching your flight! Doesn't seem to be a location in the terminal 3 Changi airport but there's definitely a place there!  For more food reviews, check out my instagram @asydneysider :smiling_face_with_open_hands:"
Xiang Gang Xin Kou Wei,A decent plate of prawn chee cheong fun. CCF was towards a thicker side but I’m ok with it. Taste pretty much like most of the other CCF. Not the best but ok to satisfy your craving if you want a nearby CCF~
Xiang Gang Xin Kou Wei,"The Mushroom Cheong fun is so good. The skin is definitely not thick. It’s translucent and very tender. Any thinner and it won’t hold the generous ingredients inside. As for their dim sum, I’d skip the char siew bun. The carrot cake is not soft, over fried and the edges are hardened from re-frying. Not fresh. The siew mai was decent. The lor mai gai was ok too I’ll pass as well. Cheong fun shiok, but the rest not so."
Xiang Gang Xin Kou Wei,We had our late lunch here. The Cheong fun was nice. I love the Teochew beef flavour as it is quite difficult to have in SG. But the soy sauce is too sweet for a Cantonese. Price was reasonable. One :star: from my hubby. He said it is the best Cheong Fun in Singapore. :thinking_face:
Xiang Gang Xin Kou Wei,The Chee Cheong Fun is great! Especially the prawn one that cost $5.00 where you will get about 8 prawn with the CCF~!! Try the Prawn Chee Cheong Fun with their Chili paste is wonderful! Great match (to me~).
Xiang Gang Xin Kou Wei,"At the start of their expansion, Chef Wei was a definite go-to for chee cheong fun.  However the novelty has seemed to die down, or perhaps its the lack of consistency amongst stalls, or maybe for me it's just not worth it to queue for an overpriced CCF which quality can be matched at other CCF speciality/dim sum shops.  For over $5 a plate, it truly isn't value for money. Presentation and portion sizes are not justifiable for the price, and the wait doesn't contribute positively to its cause. Its true that their rice rolls are(or were) silky, but recent reviews seem to suggest a dip in quality and consistency.  I would go to my favourite dim sum shop and get equally good CCF in an air conditioned setting for the same price and with more selection, so I see no reason to need to patronise any of this establishments stalls anytime soon.  @goodfoodwrite - instagram & YouTube"
Xiang Gang Xin Kou Wei,"With the renovated coffeeshop, it has brighten up the atmosphere. The chee cheong fun was delicious. They didn't scrimp on the sauce provided like other places."
Xiang Gang Xin Kou Wei,I've tried it once a few months back and it was silky smooth with a very thin layer.  Today's prawn Chee Cheong Fun was a bit too thick and the prawns were a tad too rubbery for me. Would appreciate more consistency
Xiang Gang Xin Kou Wei,Update Nov 2022: standard dropped!! CCF is now much thicker instead of silky smooth… dropping rating to 4*  Oct 2022: QQ charsiew Cheong fun at $4. Yummy!! Will re-order :)
Xiang Gang Xin Kou Wei,"Nice sweet savoury taste of Char siew with silky Cheong Fun skin. Paired beautifully with the soy sauce which is not overpowering the taste of CCF. Instead, bringing out the essence of the HKG style CCF. Chilli was nice and the lady boss is very friendly and approachable. All the CCF skin is preapred onsite with care and effort. Althouvh there wasnt a long queue but would consider this as a hidden jem. 2nd time returning to eat this. Will return again if pass by."
Xiang Gang Xin Kou Wei,Glad that there is hand made Chee Cheong fun available early in the morning. Freshly made Cheong fun are always better. Overall an enjoyable breakfast with proper plates at hawker centre. That’s a plus compared to some places service Cheong fun on styrofoam plate and plastic cutleries.
Xiang Gang Xin Kou Wei,sauce is provided separately for takeaway orders so it doesn't get soggy and it is freshly made on the spot! had the char siew chee cheong fun and i liked it a lot :)
Xiang Gang Xin Kou Wei,Nice freshly made Chee Cheong Fun. Friendly boss. Will be back to try the other types next time
Xiang Gang Xin Kou Wei,"Tried their prawn Chee Cheong Fun this morning at $5 per plate as I really enjoyed the ones sold by the stall of the same name at Pek Kio Food Centre.  Unfortunately while this Chee Cheong Fun was freshly made on site, it was much too thick resulting in rolls that were overly thick and couldn't carry sufficient sauce to be properly seasoned. (compared to the beautifully thin and silky ones at Pek Kio).  Overall rather disappointed, not worth the long queue.  Better go for Chef Wei which is located near by in a coffee shop."
Xiang Gang Xin Kou Wei,"Chanced upon this HK dim sum stall. Ordered beef cheong fun and steamed pork rib with black bean sauce. Especially impressed with the smooth, silky texture of freshly-made cheong fun wrapping tender, juicy beef slices - each bite is flavorful and heavenly!"
Xiang Gang Xin Kou Wei,Best CCF I had. Located within the coffee shop. Every CCF is freshly made upon your order. I liked the char siew ccf ($4/plate) very much. The sauce and chili sauce are good. Will come back to try the you tew and other dim sum dishes. Quality is as good as restaurant and prices are reasonable. Better than Kimly Dim Sum. Recommended.
Xiang Gang Xin Kou Wei,Chef Wei HK Cheong Fun legit! I would say it is better than some restaurants.  Love the Prawn Cheong Fun over the Char Siew one.  Follow reviewikr on Instagram and Facebook for more reviews.
Xiang Gang Xin Kou Wei,"This awesome cheong fun is definitely your first choice of breakfast, afternoon tea selection in serangoon central area here. It is silky ,smoothly and refreshing when first bite taken. Sauce are clear and good, with their signature chilli together, this cheong fun is one of the best that i ever had before."
Xiang Gang Xin Kou Wei,2 stars - Probably wouldn’t come back. Why don’t you try something with 3 stars?  Not sure if we ordered the wrong dish - you tiao Cheong fun. Cheong fun itself was fine - good texture. But the you tiao was overfried and rock hard.  Portion was generous for $4.  Open to upgrading this to 3 or 4 stars if other dishes redeem the experience during our next visit.
Xiang Gang Xin Kou Wei,"It just reopen after 3 mths renovation and it packed with people. Alot of people queuing for the pig organ soup, wanton mee and fishball noodles."
Xiang Gang Xin Kou Wei,"Delicious Malay food. Clay pot rice also good. Newly renovated since july, clean & windy. Whn u come here, malay food is a must eat."
Xiang Gang Xin Kou Wei,"Awesome traditional Malay kueh Kueh, try their epok epok ( potato curry puff and sardines puff )  Each cost $1 .  They started 10 years ago by selling their Kueh Kueh at the mama indian shop below their home .  Now they have their own stall ,  #01-45.  Open : 6.45am to 2pm Everyday.  Enjoy :face_savoring_food:"
Xiang Gang Xin Kou Wei,Newly renovated Geylang East Hawker Centre. I like the new granite flooring.
Xiang Gang Xin Kou Wei,Geylang East Central Market and Food has finally opened after closure for renovation.  The roofing and flooring have been renewed especially senior friendly floor surface.  Many stores have yet to be opened but foresee more will open.    This is one of our favourite hawker fares in the eastern side of Singapore with good number of old-schooled stores around.  Definitely a need-to-go hawker centre.
Xiang Gang Xin Kou Wei,Had the beef cheong fun. The filling inside is the similar to the steamed beef balls at dim sum restaurant. the cheong fun texture is smooth. the sauce could be a little bit better. Overall still an excellent plate of cheong fun :)
Xiang Gang Xin Kou Wei,Very nice hand made Cheong fan. The char Siew Bao and yam cake too! Price is a bit high though… waiting time 5-10 mins
Xiang Gang Xin Kou Wei,"Love their CCF, it's a 4.5 for me. With their other stuff, overall comes down to 4 stars.  I come here occasionally for breakfast. But today, it's 8.25am on 25 Apr. Only one guy, and he tells me it's not ready yet. Have to wait till 8.40. They're supposed to be open at 7am. Drops down to 3 stars.  Also, their Lava Custard Buns are hit and miss. Sometimes they serve it before the custard melts, and you end up biting into paste rather than lava custard. Drops to 2 stars.  There are signs their standard is dropping. Hope they're able to do something about it.  Update 7 May. Ordered their Lava Custard Buns again. Photo attached."
Xiang Gang Xin Kou Wei,"Greedy me decided to order 2 plates of Cheong Fun, char siew and prawn. Got my queue number and took a seat. Food was ready in about 5 minutes cause I was the only one :grinning_face_with_big_eyes:, probably because it was 2pm. Else the wait can be as long as 15-30 mins during peak period especially breakfast time. The Cheong fun is steamed and rolled on the spot, so fresh right! Love the texture, silky smooth with abundance of ingredients stuffed in each portion with a fragrant and tasty sauce accompanying it. Char siew is sweet and soft. The prawns are really fresh and there is a prawn in each spoonful of Cheong fun. Their sambal chili also happening. Abit spicy and you can taste the grounded dried prawns. There are about 4 variants available: plain, mushroom, char siew and prawn. Prices ranging from $3.00 to $5.00. I think it’s decent comparing to the portion and freshness.  Super highly recommended!!"
Xiang Gang Xin Kou Wei,"Freshly made! Damn good as well!  EDIT: The young guy was better when I came, the new guy is more or less a 3/5 standard. Taste is almost the same but I miss what I tasted months ago  EDIT: Don’t order the dim sum, it’s horrible"
Bulgogi Syo,"Had their pork collar, beef tenderloin and cheesy steamed egg. Was lucky to get a seat for 2 pax just before their last order timing (3pm, service resumes at 5pm). The food was tasty and affordable, will definitely be back again to try their other dishes!"
Bulgogi Syo,Arrived here around 5:20 for dinner on Sunday and there was already a queue.  Ordered the combo set. The meat was juicy and tender but best eaten piping hot. Doesn’t taste as good once it’s cooled down.  The soup was good and refreshing. The side dishes was free flow so nothing to complain about.
Bulgogi Syo,"Overall Food Rating: 6.5/10 1. Sharing Pork Combo 6.5/10 - The pork collar and pork belly were decently good, but the overall score is dragged down severely by the ""main star"" of the platter; the baby back ribs. They were overcooked to hell and basically as dry as the sahara desert. Flavour was okay, but definitely no saving their overdoneness.  - The best part of the combo was actually the jjigae (soup) that was served as part of the combo. It was nothing special, but just a soup done right. Flavourful and light on the stomach. And also the reason why the overall rating went from a 6 to a 6.5  2. Soy sauce fried rice 7.5/10 - Rice had a good balance of umami and saltiness. Seafood was tender but nothing special. What really elevated the dish was the crispy rice on the bottom, giving it the extra points it deserves  3. Tteokbokki 6.5/10 - The tteok's texture was good (although maybe not as chewy as I would've liked) Sauce was abit too diluted and not really sticking to the rice cakes. The kimari was really good tho, but I cannot raise the score by too much because this is about the tteokbokki, not the kimari that they put ontop.  4. Seafood pancake 7.5/10 - Decently crispy with good flavour. Textbook korean seafood pancake.  Overall comments: Pretty normal korean food place. Worth a try, but definitely not a must try."
Bulgogi Syo,"There is always a long queue at this restaurant, managed to get a table for 2 when I reach at 5pm when it opened. I would say it is an interesting experience with the open flame when they serve the meat. Nice place and food is decent, I wouldn’t say it is out of this world but it’s not too bad. A bit pricey I think but worth a try"
Bulgogi Syo,"Very pack restaurant.  Despite its was so pack, the service was fast & foods were tasty.  Pork combo set - value for money & delicious.  Side dishes are free flow and taste good especially seasoned tomatoes & kimchi :face_savoring_food:."
Bulgogi Syo,"Patronized with a friend last month and liked it enough to return again with my wife. Conclusion: We love it! Went for the sharing combo this time. Excellent! However, would love for the pumpkin to be seasoned... Slightly salted perhaps? The vegetable hotplate is kinda dry TBH. We really enjoyed our meal. Props to the friendly and responsive crew despite the crowd."
Bulgogi Syo,4 stars for service. We had excellent and attentive service from a server called Bing ---- (forgot full name). However the other server at the cashier counter (tall skinny guy) forgot our 1st order of kimchi pancake and we ended up waiting for a long time for it after the rest of our food came.
Bulgogi Syo,"Very popular place at dinner time, but the queue moved relatively fast. Banchan was free flow, but just four options. The food was exceptional, portions were big and the meats were well seasoned. The flambe show at the table was interesting albeit the fire was not too large. Will definitely revisit to try other dishes."
Bulgogi Syo,First time visit Bulgigi syo celebrating hubby’s bday. The AM served at front door is very accommodating & approachable. Thumbs up for his service. The food above our expectations but the side dish need hv more variety. Overall a very good dining experience here! Highly recommended to all sort of gathering over here.
Bulgogi Syo,"Taste wise, not good but not bad? I definitely don't think back to this meal nor do I want to go back. I mean if you're in the area and not sure of what to eat you can try this place out but other than that I wouldn't say it's really worth visiting.  :fork_and_knife_with_plate: For more bite-sized reviews, head over to my TikTok page: @chowdownx"
Flying Pig,"Visited this shop at its new Citygate location, and ordered the buddy set ($38) for 2 to share among my small family (2A1C). The omelette fried rice is non spicy, so it is child friendly. Was thinking of ordering an additional dish (chicken wings) to share, but the food portion is pretty solid, so it was enough for us. Omelette fried rice is very nice, definitely a signature dish. Tom yum basil clear soup is too spicy for me (had a few cough after the first sip), but luckily the set came with Thai milk tea so it helped to wash it down :face_with_tears_of_joy:. Will come again to try the pork noodles soup, which is another signature."
Flying Pig,"Their star attraction is their Crab Omelette Rice ($10), and rightfully so. Presentation-wise, it looks really inviting, with large, visible crab meat chunks resting on top of a fluffy omelette, enveloping a bed of white rice.  If prawns are your preferred seafood, don’t fret. Their Prawn Omelette Rice ($10) is equally satisfying, albeit a little less hyped up by the public. Their juicy prawns are completely deshelled, perfect for lazy people, myself included.  Their signboard proudly proclaims that they are the “Noodle Queen”, so we had to at least try one noodle dish to see how they matched up. Their Beef Noodle Soup ($7) came with a good selection of ingredients such as beef tendon, beef balls, and tons of fried lard in a piping hot broth."
Flying Pig,New Flying Pig Location #02-03 City Gate since 1st May 2023. Great Food but very Spicy. Ask for less Spicy. Love their Crab & Prawn Omelette. Their Buddy Set Meal also available during weekend which is very affordable. Will be back to try out other dishes=)
Flying Pig,"We over ordered (as usual). The serving staff was nice enough to change us to a table for 3 to accommodate the food  We had their Papaya salad, stir fry cabbage, panang chicken curry, moo ping, Omelette Fried Rice with prawn & crab  We enjoyed most of them.  The Papaya salad was legit (ie. nice and spicy). Their panang curry was very lemak, if you like lemak, this curry will tingle your taste buds. Mooping was also well marinated and made from lean meat. It was well grilled and paired very well with Thai sweet chilli. The Omelette on the fried rice was fluffy and light and was well sprinkled with chunks of prawn and crab meat. The fried rice itself was maybe a bit too buttery, but still aroy mak mak lah.  Only the stir fry cabbage was oooookish, otherwise all good we thought.  Satisfying !"
Flying Pig,Ordered the crab omelette fried rice which was good. Eggs were cooked perfectly. Other rice dishes comes with just the dish and rice. No fried egg on top unlike what other stores offer with similar price range. Service is okay. Place is small. Long queues can be seen during lunch time so plan your dining time.
Ja Kin Mukata,"Price Quite Steep As Is Located In A Coffeeshop. Prawns Was OOS And Therefore Replaced By Pork Collar Instead. Ala Carte Abalone , Smoked Duck @  +$5 Each, Beef @ +$8.80 x2. Marinated Meat Actually Quite Flavourful. Staff Ladies Overall Quite Friendly As Well. Bill  Est Abt $63++ Nett."
Ja Kin Mukata,"My go to place for Mookata in Yishun! Super authentic thai mookata, from the sauces you know they are legit. The XXL platter is filled with a variety of well seasoned meats, basically trying all their marinates available. Its good for 4 pax or a very hungry 2 pax. Broth is yummy too. There are tomyam seasoning packets available at the counter so you dont need to buy the mama noodles for tomyam soup base either.  Affordable and yummy! Highly recommend!"
Ja Kin Mukata,"I loved this mookata place when they were at yishun. Once we found out they have changed location, we will always travel all the way just to have this mookata! A lot of different flavours and I really like their chilli! Definitely one of the good mookata out there! Worth trying! :smiling_face_with_heart-eyes::face_savoring_food:"
Ja Kin Mukata,"While we did enjoy certain dining aspects of this place, there were quite a few off-putting factors.  We visited the outlet at Carros Centre on a weekday night, and we were maybe the only 2-3 tables having mookata there. From the moment we placed the order and paid, we waited at least 30-40minutes for the first platter of meat to be served. Not sure if they were waiting for the meat to defrost or…. But this waiting time for mookata / uncooked food is really strange. The service was also pretty bad.  The soup was also VERY bland even after we added the seasoning packet from the instant noodles.  On the up side, they have a great variety of flavours to choose from and some of them are really done well! We particularly enjoyed the Tom yum, mala and garlic flavoured meat. The black pepper was pretty bad, but everything else we tried was decent!  Go if you like bland soup?"
Ja Kin Mukata,Great place for friends to gather and have a meal! Big platters with many choices!
The One Tom Yam Mee,"not nice at all. pork soup was smelly. tom yum was salty and not nice. fried pork belly was hard and lukewarm. overall 4/10, edible but not worth it and will not come back."
The One Tom Yam Mee,"Decent #TomYan soup base, spicy level is 3.5/5. Portion not big, suitable for small eaters. 2 pieces of everything show in photo plus some white cabbage for SGD $6.80. . #StanzFoodHunts #有间TomYamMee #TheOneTomYamMee #ThaiCuisine #HawkerCuisine #AngMoKio"
The One Tom Yam Mee,"Late night looking for comfort food for the hungry stomachs after a late night movie. Best food to have on a rainy night. Tried their 2 specialties noodles, one Tom Yam and another Pork Bone noodles. Both were great and satisfying. You can even choose you own ingredients if you wish for a different noodle bowl from their standard recommendations. Try it if you are around the area."
The One Tom Yam Mee,"Spicy and shiok, it was a very flavourful bowl of tom yum soup noodles. For a usual bowl of tom yum noodles, it consisted of 2 fresh prawns, crab sticks, a fishcake, a small slice of fish, a small piece of cuttlefish and some cabbage. A little ex for the portion, $7.10. One can choose to add on vegetables, meat or seafood. Will return to try the noodles with pork broth. Service staff was friendly and polite. The coffee shop was very warm, do choose to sit outside if having a meal there."
The One Tom Yam Mee,"Yummy Tom yum noodles , prawns and fried fish is a strong point, minus for meatball and vege"
Mocchi,"First time eating at Maccha House- came by on the Hari Raya Haji public holiday around 7pm for dinner.  I’m not sure if this is a consistent problem, but the wait for the food was extremely long. We ordered 3 sukiya hotpot sets and received our food about 30 minutes after ordering. Even before we got any dishes, the long wait left a bad taste in our mouths.  However, I must say that the food is really good. The broth was thick and rich, and the hotpot was filled with ingredients. Plenty of meat and veggies! It was really filling and delicious. The chawanmushi and dessert sides were also good.  Did not order any of the matcha drinks or desserts but I did try some of my friend’s matcha latte. It was smooth and sweet, not grainy or grassy like you would get at other places.  After GST and service charge, one sukiyaki hotpot set costs $16.50, which is pretty value for money considering the large portion size and quality of food. The long wait might have been because they were understaffed, it is worth looking into. Overall really enjoyed the food but I’m not sure if I would visit this branch again."
Mocchi,"They offered the mains in set meal style. But our experience with all 3 sets were good! Taste and portion were up to expectations. Overall the portion is good cos we could eat a variety of things - the main meat, rice, soup, chahwamushi and even a small slice of cake! Dont need to order separately! Meals were served quite quickly but condition was ok when we ate, no issue.  Their signboard was not very prominent and I only knew it was Maccha House after I saw the menu. Itd a pity. Had their maccha dessert and drinks before elsewhere and it was good."
Mocchi,"Affordable and delicious Japanese cuisine in Marina with spectacular view of the Fountain of Wealth (the world’s largest fountain recorded in the Guinness Book of World Records in 1998). The ambience and setting of the restaurant were casual and comfortable. Service was excellent. A great place to dine and chill out with family and friends. The sukiyaki hotpot set was value for money. The rich sukiyaki broth was comforting and delectable. The beef was tender and tasty. Onsen tamago was perfect. Tofu, mushrooms, carrots and assorted vegetables, all were fresh and delicious. Had chicken karaage as side dish. Chicken was tender and crispy. Not oily. The maccha cream latte was rich, delicious and velvety. All were beautifully presented. A great gastronomical experience plus the stunning view of the Fountain of Wealth completed a very satisfying meal. Worth every cent."
Mocchi,"Great value for matcha with a strong matcha essence! S-tier! Unlike the utter blasphemy of the matcha next door (Tamago en's matcha is just a sacrilegious premix)  Warabi mochi w tiramisu was B tier, tiramisu was creamy but lacks the matcha infusion and warabi mochi was decent (Technically there was an S tier one near by this place so I was spoilt for that)"
Mocchi,"Enjoyed a glass of iced matcha latte here, but you can’t adjust sugar level"
Mocchi,"Conveniently located in Suntec city basement. So many choices to choose from this matcha heaven!  Definitely worth getting the warabimochi— so soft and easy to chew. About $15 for a big box, I had to control myself and not finished everything in one go. Pair it with warm tea or soft serve is a good idea.  I also tried the matcha red bean pancake, really nice too! I wish there’s more outlets around the island."
Mocchi,"Anything premade such as ice cream, great. Anything made by the worker like the matcha,; bad. Not worth the price for the taste/quality. In this case the Matcha Smoothie. Without the float, it doesn’t justify the price of 6.50 at all, but with additional one dollar, the ice cream kinda save the smoothie. Won’t come back again."
Mocchi,My go-to stall in Suntec City for matcha desserts :face_savoring_food: Recently got their parfait—it was yummy and the portion is ideal for 2 pax sharing. Somehow I prefer the hojicha parfait better :sparkles:
Mocchi,Really nice mochi. The price is on the high side but the mochi is very soft and smooth. The taste and the level of sweetness are just nice too. Highly recommended.
Mocchi,"Everything looks good on the menu, it was a real struggle to decide what to order.  My partner who dislikes Matcha dessert became an instant convert after trying the $8.50 Matcha soft serve with brown sugar, mochi and red bean. The soft serve :soft_ice_cream: has a wonderful balance between the bitterness of its Matcha and the sugar. This is absolutely love at first try! I’ll be back!  Staffed by only 1 crew at 9pm but dessert served instantly upon order! Amazing speed!"
Mocchi,Interesting selection of chocolates and cakes. The popular ones need one day before your event to order. The staff is very courteous to my parents even explaining what is inside the chocolate. Overall experience is great.
Mocchi,I tried two cakes - strawberry ($10) and chocolate ($10) for takeaway. They looked great but tasted ok - the strawberry one was very gelatinous and the chocolate one didn’t have a very intense flavour. I have enjoyed the desserts at 2am but these ones were quite disappointing. I have had much better cakes from Origin+ Bloom at MBS or from Lemuel Chocolate.  The service was also meh - the gentleman working there was busy with inventory and took a while to get his attention. He was slow and not very friendly.
Mocchi,"The chocolates were awesome. I tried the praline ones, coffee, yuzu and chocolate. Its just awesome the bonbons. Tried the mochi mango and chocolate too. ITS A MUST BUY GUYS. THE MOCHI, ITS SOFT, CHEWY AND NOT FLOURY. ITS THIN AND REAL RICH IN TASTE. DAMN GOOD!"
Mocchi,"Very creative and brilliant as a gift. I’m sure your receiver will love the gift la. But I would say it is expensively chocolate cos the price is likely contributed by their colourful packaging. Probably will just try once because of the price. The local flavour like Laksa Leaf Lemongrass, bakkwa chicken, chilli padi were recommended by the staffs as unique SG’s flavour. For parents with kids, you can get the edible crayons for your kids. Something fresh."
Mocchi,"Colourful chocolates in boxes make great gifts. All of the ones I tried (non alcoholic, non savoury) in a box of 16 were delicious. Dark choc espresso cookies are also wonderful with coffee. Pairs of cookie jars make much appreciated CNY presents (cards and small carry bags available in store)."
Mocchi,"Beautiful cafe with lovely interior decor. Service was warm and friendly and food was great!!! Durian desserts are palatable even for non-lovers, but durian lovers might wish for a stronger punch. Still a great place to hang out for couple dates or with friends."
Mocchi,There's indoor and outdoor sitting. Very nice environment. Durian shake is a must try. Durain coffee so so... Durian cake if missed nothing to regret. Tiramisu is another dessert not to be missed. Damage done; about more than sgd 30 per person is on the expensive side for just desserts and drinks.
Mocchi,"First time here with friends for desserts and drinks. The desserts were unique and yummy, we especially like the Creme Brulee which come with ice cream. The service crew (KP and Ivan) were also very friendly and nice. We will definitely come here again =)"
Mocchi,First time here and the staff were very nice esp. Ms. Adeline Lee.  We told here we got old folks and would like to sit inside as we did not do any reservation. She is so kind to accede to our request.  We were a bit late and the durian cheese cake were sold out so we took the normal durian cake which tasted as good.   The rest of the food we ordered were yummy too.  We highly recommend this place to anyone who wish to have a dessert and love durians.
Mocchi,"Durian~lious food at Ms. Durian with Great Array of Durian desserts and the main dish are also nice, presentation and well commendable. I would definitely come back again with my friends and family."
Mocchi,Tried warabi mochi sundae ..it was unique experience.. the cream cheese icecream was really tasty. We added matcha and plain mochi to cream cheese sundae filled with bean curd and cornflakes
Mocchi,"Slightly bruised softserve bear, but a cute and refreshing drink nonetheless. We topped up $2 for three pieces of warabimochi."
Mocchi,"Inconsistent shop hours, but excellent service.  We ordered a side of cream cheese soft serve along with a matcha/ cream cheese sundae with warabi mochi.  The soft serve arrived pretty ...well...soft... and melted extremely fast. While I felt that the matcha soft serve was fine, the cream cheese one reminded me more of yoghurt (not in a bad way!) than cream cheese. I guess I was expecting more of a cheese flavor. I was pretty disappointed with the warabimochis as both flavours were pretty tasteless and the texture was quite odd. Don Don Donki has better warabimochi.  That being said, the service is lovely. While I don't regret going, I won't be back."
Mocchi,"Matcha tiramisu contains bites of white chocolate, it's ok I feel. Matcha crepe's skin was quite thick. Taste quite milky, but overall not too bad."
Mocchi,Tried both maccha & hojicha latte. Good can taste the tea
Ten Tenths,"A small eatery at e basement of Havelock II, it serves up a variety of dishes but do try the crispy roast pork belly with fragrance rice (that tastes like chicken rice)! The signature spicy char siu had a good amount of fat & gave a hint of mala taste. The fried mee siam was not bad too, came with the same soup as the rice dishes.  IG @pingguo301"
Ten Tenths,Decently good roast meat place and can get really busy during lunch hours. The rice bowl goes for $9.90 and they also have option for noodles.  Service was friendly too!
Ten Tenths,"Came during weekday lunch at 1pm. Ordered char siew and roasted pork rice takeaway. The rice is very fragrant, chilli given is not too spicy, just nice for my tasting. I especially love their roasted pork, it has crispy skin and tender meat. The char siew however, is less flavourful and hard to chew (for me), but it’s decent. Chicken rice came with Japanese style egg :egg:, total cost about $10.20. $0.30 for takeaway. Food is on a pricey end."
Ten Tenths,"Hole in the wall place at the basement, the crispy roast pork is crispy on the outside and juicy and tender in the middle. Char siew is smoky and provides just the right chewy and lean texture. Very well priced at 9.90 too."
Ten Tenths,"This stall is located at B1 of Havelock2 building. Come early for weekday lunches because this place gets packed real fast. Delicious food with mouth-watering pork! Both char siu and roast pork tastes soooo good! But if I were to choose, my highlight would be the roast pork. It’s melt-in-your-mouth tender with a crispy roasted skin and just enough fat to satisfy without being overwhelming :drooling_face: if you’re a chili lover, the chili is exceptional too, and really enhances and spices up the noodles and eating experience! The iced honey lemon is very refreshing and the colors makes it a very Instagram-worthy drink! I’m definitely coming back again :red_heart:"
Big Boy Franks,Quite pricey but so so good! If you can pay for shake shack this is definitely on par. Support this local business and get your burger cravings covered. Hot bun and juicy beef! Delicious :face_savoring_food:
Big Boy Franks,"Bought the beef chili fries, it cost $7.50. Steep but really alot plus where else do u get beef chili fries.  Didn't expect the cheese but there it is. Beef has those tumeric taste but not spicy at all... Lack chili to be honest.  If you love junk food you will probably like this more than me. Definitely better shared.  Tried their mentaiko fries. The serving of mentaiko is very generous, never knew that they are suppose to be so sour. Anw having tried a few good fries recently I find that their fries isn't the most crispy maybe chef can opt for the more traditional KFC cheese fries type of crisp or lack there of and make their fries more crispy like hawker fries."
Big Boy Franks,Quite disappointing for a 16bucks burger (thru grab on apr23) to be like this.. totally speechless  Soggy bun .. :smiling_face_with_tear:
Big Boy Franks,Wanted to try. Shop opens at 5.00pm. Came from Jurong to try. Reached at 5.15pm not open. Walked around came back at 5.45pm still not open. Please amend your opening hours. It was such a waste of time.
Big Boy Franks,"Been eating their burger since they started their shop at Yung kuang road, never disappointed. The meat is soft and tender. Hotdog,fries and many more. Will definitely return and buy more"
Big Boy Franks,"Well, not entirely blown away by the burger TBH. The bun was good but the patty was rather normal and slightly overdone. Considering its $7, I'd consider it comfort food and will get it again.  The hot dog was a miss for me. At $9, I definitely can think of places that have better ones and are cheaper.  Cheese fries was a huge portion! Good to share for 3 average eaters.  Swung by on a weekday evening and it was as still as the night... I was the only one there throughout my meal."
Big Boy Franks,"The owner of the stall is extremely kind and warm, he provides quality service and delicious food that people should try! Although the place is not air-conditioned, the food and the environment makes up for it. Those looking for affordable, good portion and great tasty food and a great hangout spot, I highly recommend coming down here as I've been here a couple times and they continue to improve on their food and was I really hooked by the positive experience overall."
Big Boy Franks,Tried their burgerd before and their newest creation the smash burger is to die for.  Worth your travelling time to try their burgers and hotdog buns.
Big Boy Franks,"many great points for this local business! firstly, if you are looking for night time snacks or dinner for family gatherings, BBF has what you need. secondly, their delivery time is on point that you dont have to keep waiting for long. third, you have to try their hummus and mash potato, they are both delicious and nice. overall, the food was delicious with the awesome sauces and sides to go along with the meal. a 10/10 for me!"
Big Boy Franks,"Read some reviews of the beef patty being slimy and having a weird texture, while some said it was the best burger they have ever had. So I decided to come down to see what the fuss was about.  Alas, to my disappointment, the former is right as the beef is not a patty at all. It is mushy and feels to me like it is just corned beef from a can with no flavour. The bun was quite nicely toasted though. I gave it an extra star as their chili con carne served on their prata hot dog was pretty decent. However, be warned that their chicken hot dog is just the normal supermarket hot dog. Overall prices are on the high side too.  Pretty unique concept also as it is literally at the void deck of a hdb flat and you eat at the hdb tables and benches.  Will not be visiting again though."
Hanjip Korean Grill House,"Ordered pork platter because not Everyone can eat beef that day. Pork was super good, side dishes like pancake is semi crispy and good as well! My favourite is their complimentary starters that comes with kimchi and lotus slices! Will go back hanjip again."
Hanjip Korean Grill House,"Some of the best Korean food outside of Korea. The flavours are definitely authentic and there are some dishes here that I have not even seen before but were all delicious. The amount of side dishes in itself was an affair - and they are refillable upon request. The mains were great, I ordered some dishes that I frequent at other Korean restaurants and safe to say they were just executed better here. Didn’t even get to take proper photos because the food was too good!  The restaurant is big but you might have to book depending on the time and night that you choose to go. It’s a lovely venue with a great and simple aesthetic. The waitstaff aren’t exactly friendly but they do their job very well, even cooking the food for you.  If you are a fan of Korean BBQ or even just Korean food in general then this is a place that you should come and visit!"
Hanjip Korean Grill House,"Very pricey. Been to several other kbbq places (especially those around tanjong pagar area) so I've things to compare to.  - they do not cook for you, an important part of the experience to me - the platter did not include any soup nor steamed egg which most other kbbq places do - much less appetizers provided than other places, only 3 plates - service was meh at best overall, we requested for a refill of lettuce but staff was never to be seen again. The next time we saw a staff was when she was getting us to pay the bill.  Food was tasty, but definitely not worth the price and (lack of) service. Even though we had a discounted chope voucher ($70 for $100 voucher), I felt it was still less worth than the other places I frequent."
Hanjip Korean Grill House,"Started our feast with an array of delectable refillable banchan. We enjoyed Hanjip platter which came with premium cuts of USDA Prime Ribeye & Boneless Short Rib, Kurobuta Pork Belly & Marinated Pork Collar. Superb handsfree dine-in experience here and we could just sit back & relax while enjoying the mouth-watering meat with perfect tenderness served by friendly Hanjip's crew. Thumbs up for their top notch service. Special mention to the pork belly with ideal meat to fats ratio which gave the ultimate juiciness and even better when wrapped with lettuce. The premium meat tasted great on its own without any condiments.  We also enjoyed: :chopsticks:Ginseng chicken soup: Made with real Korean ginseng roots, the broth was rich and flavourful! Chicken was tender and the broth was  comforting to have. :chopsticks:Stirred fried spicy chicken with cheese: Cheese lovers cannot miss this. Order this to practise your perfect cheese pull. :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes: :chopsticks:Spicy seafood tofu stew: Packed with punch and appetizing! Loaded with generous amount of fresh seafood and tofu was smooth & silky. :chopsticks:Seafood pancake: Thick omelette style pancake was filled with ingredients and panfried to appetizing golden brown. :chopsticks:Steamed egg: Simple dish that was well executed. We finished up the fluffy & flavourful steamed egg quickly.  K-bbq would be incomplete without any soju. We got 3 bottles of Chorong Chorong Soju at $45++ with their ongoing alcohol promo. Green grape soju was our favourite as it was refreshing and paired really well with the bbq meat.  Definitely a hidden gem that I will recommend if you are looking for a good Korean BBQ night out with family & friends. We are already planning our next visit. For even better deal, make your reservation via Chope to enjoy a complimentary plate of Wagyu brisket!"
Hanjip Korean Grill House,"Love their positivity!! Have been seeing this on social media for a while. Finally had a chance to try it out. First impression was really good. It’s obvious that a lot of thought and money went into the ID of the place. Seats were comfortable and tables were large and spacious. Private rooms look really comfortable too. Service was impeccable. Unfortunately, food was a tad average. I would have given them more stars for the fantastic service and interior but the food was a bit lacklustre.  Price was a bit high. Almost $600 for 5 pax. And we only ordered 1 beer, and 5 cold teas so there wasn’t really any alcohol to inflate the bill. The BBQ meat we ordered were of very very good quality though.  Ordered meat platters with a range of beef and pork. Also ordered many sides and soups. There was a range of banchan provided too.  Kimchi was nice. And I loved the Ikan bilis and peanut. The other banchan were nice too.  Ginseng chicken soup was tasteless. Needed a larger dose of ginseng and salt for flavour. Kimchi stew was barely there, considering kimchi is a pretty strong ingredient, the stew lacked body. Omelette with cheese also needed salt Pancake was bland Japchae was the only nice appetizer we had. Korean fried chicken wings were nicely seasoned.  BBQ was done by staff, so the meats were cooked perfectly. The quality of the meats were really good too. The exhaust is pretty good too so not much of a smoky smell. You might still need to change if you’re going back to work after the meal. The onions were too raw for me though. Most of the meats weren’t seasoned which was ok coz we could decide which dipping sauce we wanted to eat or just enjoy the grilled taste. However, there was 1 super salty marinated pork and I think there might have been a boatload of msg in it. It left me with a super dry mouth and feeling super thirsty for a few hours after. Dessert was a nice touch, mango ice-cream."
Snap Cafe,"love the cosy atmosphere at snap cafe!! had their signature pistachio espresso latte, which was creamy and nutty! great for coffee lovers who prefer nutty notes. great and friendly cafe owners & staff! will definitely come back again to try others :smiling_face:"
Snap Cafe,A really nice place to relax with good drinks and pastries. We got the chocolate and matcha drinks which tasted really rich and not too sweet. We also got the black sesame cheesecake and it tasted delicious. Not too heavy and the balance of flavours were just right.
Snap Cafe,A really chill place to relax and grab a quick cup of coffee. The rosaries were pleasant as well. Owners of the cafe are very nice and service is great. Just a really good place to vibe and chill!! Recommend 10/10
Snap Cafe,Popped by Snap Cafe today with a friend and we ordered an ice white + an ice mocha.  It's one of the better coffee you can get here in Singapore and it's reasonably  priced as well. The owner shared with us how they taste the coffee after each shot to ensure that it is well calibrated (Not sure if i'm explaining this right BUT you get my point)  10/10 would recommend!!!!!
Snap Cafe,"They were having a 1-1 opening drink promotion over a three day period. I had the Lychee Delight ($6) which was quite refreshing. The space is quite small, nice place to chill.  Baked goods only available from 10 July. Wished they were available because there were many interesting combinations like matcha injeolmi canele and black sesame cheesecake crumble. Will try them next time."
Crolo,"Don't bother. The pastry looks nice but not the same when it comes to taste. Croissant is tough and the filling like the milo dinosaur is hard. To me, this combination just doesn't make sense."
Crolo,Awesome croissants with wide selections! I was surprised by their appealing presentation  when I passed by this shop and that I couldn't resist giving it a try. They even offer buy 6 free 2 when the price is already quite low. Nice! :face_savoring_food::thumbs_up:
Crolo,Sooooo much bakes that look superrr good! However taste wise tastes like normal bakes. they seem to specialise in croissants and croffles! prices are from the $1.20- $3.50~ range  place is nice and cute.  .
Crolo,":round_pushpin:crollo by swee heng  (i went to the one in Jurong point, but there’s one at AMK hub and Northpoint too!)  general: this is a sort of croffle/croissant place by swee heng, sells mostly these two items,, have a super worth it offer of buy 6 croissants/croffles,, you’re allowed to pick 2 for free!! really super crowded, had to wait 15-20 mins to order, hype is real:fire::fire:  price::money_with_wings::money_with_wings:  I’ll write my reviews based on a clockwise manner, starting from the mango croffle.  :mango::waffle: 𝕞𝕒𝕟𝕘𝕠 𝕔𝕣𝕠𝕗𝕗𝕝𝕖  this croffle was topped with fresh,sour mangoes and almond flakes. the croffle was not so crunchy, was rather soft but the mangoes and almond flakes were really of high quality, a perfect balance of sweet and sour:smiling_face::smiling_face:  𝕓𝕚𝕤𝕔𝕠𝕗𝕗 𝕔𝕣𝕠𝕚𝕤𝕤𝕒𝕟𝕥  this croissant was topped with biscoff spread and lotus biscuit, I felt that this biscoff spread was too much, which made the croissant too sweet, but since i love biscoff not a problem for me:weary_face::weary_face:  𝕣𝕖𝕕 𝕧𝕖𝕝𝕧𝕖𝕥 𝕔𝕣𝕠𝕚𝕤𝕤𝕒𝕟𝕥  my favourite one of all, this croissant was topped with a red velvet cake spread with cream cheese on top and marble sweets, really the best one to me because the cake went so well with the cream cheese, and really best croissant EVERR:pleading_face::pleading_face:  𝕠𝕣𝕖𝕠 𝕔𝕣𝕖𝕒𝕞 𝕔𝕙𝕖𝕖𝕤𝕖 𝕔𝕣𝕠𝕚𝕤𝕤𝕒𝕟𝕥  this was also quite nice, topped with cream cheese and two super moist and soft Oreos in between, was really filling and tasty:smiling_face_with_sunglasses::smiling_face_with_sunglasses:  𝔸𝕡𝕡𝕝𝕖 𝕔𝕣𝕦𝕞𝕓𝕝𝕖 𝕔𝕣𝕠𝕗𝕗𝕝𝕖  didn’t really like this one, apples weee too sour and the croffle was soggy, the croffles in my opinion ARENT what u should get from crollo, do get the croissants instead!!  𝕓𝕚𝕤𝕔𝕠𝕗𝕗 𝕞𝕚𝕟𝕚 𝕔𝕙𝕖𝕖𝕤𝕖𝕔𝕒𝕜𝕖  didn’t like this at all, too much cream cheese in the cake, very clumped together and yep that’s it.  overall: 7/10"
Crolo,"i bought 1 yesterday to try, affordable price ($2.70~) and it was sooooo good and yummy! i came back again today and bought 4! :D they have different flavours today. can't wait to try! oh, and the packaging is so nice too, they put it in containers instead of plastic so the croffle toppings are not affected. so much thought put into it! i really love this store :)"
Crolo,Bought the 6 plus 2 free crossaint promo today. Got the KitKat and Milo flavours. I enjoyed both the flavours as I love chocolate. Price wise I find it reasonable. About 3 dollars per crossaint depending on the flavours. Service wise didn't expect much but was good enough for me.
Crolo,"Love the bright and cheerful display of croissants. Service staff was efficient and courteous. I wanted to try the croffle (croissant and waffle) variation but it seems that they have changed them to croroll (croissant and rolls) now.  Got the mango croroll and strawberry custard croissant. Ate them cold, pastry was crispy and smelled fragrant and good. Lots of diced juicy mango with a nice mix of sweet and sour. Custard cream on both the desserts were a little too sweet for me though. But still a very pleasing and light dessert!"
Crolo,First time trying. Bought these few..  Mango Croffle - super nice.. Waffle with cream and very generous portion fresh mango.. @$3.20 each.. Worth buying  Chicken Mayo croissant - mayo+chicken.. Nice as always..  Yakitori croissant - nicer if yakitori is (warm) heat up..  Chicken cutlet croissant - good to try..  Chocolate Pistachio - good spread of pistachio top with chocolate chips and a thick layer of chocolate cream within... Nice!!  Overall.. Like their sweet ones!!  Excellent service @nort point outlet!!  Will buy again!!!
Crolo,"Definitely a healthier option compared to half a dozen of donuts.  Love how vibrant and wide variety of options to choose from, would recommend their peach crolo! It’s amazing how they made the bread croissant into waffle shape and love the texture, it didn’t turn soggy despite the fact that the custard cream was resting on it!  The tuna croissant is on the saltier side."
Crolo,"Interesting concept to have a mini croissant snack bar.  Novelty 10/10 Taste 6~7/10  Not comparable to real fresh made quality croissants and waffles. Fun to eat once in a while but nothing really worth going back for. At this price point, I’d rather go for a decent sourdough bread or a proper real quality croissant like the ones from Paul. Not gimmicky fancy, but real and good."
Crolo,"Always a queue at Crolo, finally trying it since I got a ShopBack voucher. They have mini croissants at $1.30 and bigger ones with more substantial fillings such as tuna Mayo/chilli crab mayo etc at $3.20. I got a mini chocolate custard croissant and it actually pretty big and enough for breakfast (the standard croissant size at local bakeries). Heated it up the next day before eating, taste wise was pretty average. It was more dough-y than flakey, and there is not enough air pockets. They also didn’t give a lot of custard so it gets a little dry after a few bites.  Still pretty worth the price though, would buy it occasionally or as gifts."
Crolo,I bought 6 croissants for one box this afternoon by Tampines MRT. The promotion is buy 6 get 2 free( free items are fixed: now are   chocolate soft bread).All of them look yummy and the snow crab croissant is my favorite. Can't wait to taste other kinds of croissants next time.
Crolo,"I stumbled upon this stall, which has a wide variety of pastries. I bought walnut cream cheese and tiramisu croissants $2.80 each.  Surprisingly, the croissants were crispy and delicious that I decided to go back and buy more. They tasted as good as their looks. I was blown away by the croissants."
Crolo,Decent pastry for the price. Lots of unique creations. I was pleasantly surprised that the croissant was actually still slightly crispy under all that cream and toppings. Also glad that these were not too sweet. Just nice. Manage your expectations here. This is not premium but fun stuff. It’s ok lah.  Ps. I brought the Prawn Mentaiko croffle home and air-fried it at 200degC for 3-5min and it blew my mind. It became a beast! Damn shiok! That’s how you enjoy a savory croffle. Damn!
Crolo,"Yummy croissant, I ordered biscof n forget the other one... But both :thumbs_up:. I just order salty caramel croissant so yummmy :thumbs_up:"
Crolo,"One of our favourite bakery! Their Crolos are very delicious & are made fresh. Many different flavours to choose from. You will be spoilt for choice. Bun is very soft, fragrant & the ingredients are fresh as well.  There's a long queue usually. But it's worth the wait. Highly recommend to try it!"
Crolo,"Bought flavors of croissants :croissant: include chilli crab, chick mayo, egg mayo, tuna , strawberry and chick with ham to share with my team during IWD . Everyone enjoyed it so well. I can’t wait to try more flavors . It was a pleasant surprise to know this is under the wing of swee Heng . Never failed to provide quality and good taste ."
Crolo,"Don't bother to try. The pastry looks nice but not the same when it comes to taste. Croissant is tough and the filling like the milo dinosaur is hard. To me, this combination just doesn't make sense."
Crolo,I recently tried the chili crab croissant & almond croissant here and they were both quite good. The chili crab croissant had the good balance of spiciness & creaminess. I also found the price to be reasonable for the quality and taste of the croissants.
Crolo,Horrible attitude from the person who helped take my croissants. If the staff is unhappy with her job please do not take it out on the customers. What a unpleasant store.
Crolo,"A new crossiant concept by Swee heng. Was immediately attracted to the full shelves of crossiant with so many flavours to choose from. Got the KitKat and pistachio-choc to try, quite nice. I would try other flavours the next time."
Crolo,Tried 60% of their menu. Personally found the croissant to be too dry. A good croissant should be flaky on the outside while soft and almost chewy on the inside. Crolo’s croissants are just dry and flaky. Swee heng’s croissant are nicer.
Crolo,"yums, croissant was nice and i think it’s worth the price"
Crolo,Got the custard croissants. They were great! Would come again
Crolo,
Crolo,The crews were nice and also friendly. Saw some negative feedback all and all the bakery shop is clean and tidy.  Price is indicate early. For taste of the croissants is really depend on individual liking.  The varieties of pastries for a small shop is considered spoil of choice for me.  Pastries are fresh and handle in a acceptable level.  Worth the try for croissants lovers at a acceptable cost.
Crolo,Very nice bun and croissant. Buy 6 free 2 items from the $1.20 selection. The queue during peak hour is usually very long.
Crolo,Many flavours stuffed croissant. Taste nice!
Crolo,"The staff name Alice lim, did not bothered to ask if I want it to be packed together when she told over from another staff. Until I request I want it be to packed individually.I told the staff when I place the bread tray at the counter. Then staff the are just in the own world ."
Crolo,They changed the size and removed the filling for Biscoff croissant. They charge 2.80 per piece but now give a much smaller croissant minus the filling that used to be inside it. Not worth it.
Chen's Mapo Tofu,"After a long and hard session at the gym on a rainy Sunday morning, I feel like having something spicy and hot to cheer up my mood. So,I went to Chen's Mapo Tofu at Downtown Gallery to have lunch for the first time.  I ordered 'Traditional Mapo Tofu, Hot & Sour Soup, Duck Karaage and Spicy Szechuan Dumplings. Let me say, the Mapo Tofu is exceptional. The taste of the tofu is great and be cautious that the spice level is not for the faint hearted (i.e. I ordered spice level 2, and level 3 is the hottest) I can say that the tofu was cooked to perfection and highly recommend it to anyone that welcomes spice challenge.  Hot and Sour Soup and Spicy Szechuan dumplings surprised my taste buds with the freshness of the dumplings and the heat level of the soup.The filling of the dumplings are fresh and couple perfectly with the mala sauce. The balance between spiciness and sourness of the soup is incredible. The spice level was perfect and did not overpower the sourness of the soup, My partner and I thoroughly enjoyed the soup and the dumplings without any complaints.  The highlight of this lunch has to be the Duck Karaage. The duck meat was cut in bite size cubes and lightly battered, then they were deep fried to perfection. The battered shell of the karaage was crunchy and the duck meat inside was juicy and tender. The duck meat was seasoned well and required no additional seasoning for taste. I highly recommend this dish and it is a must try.  Overall, my partner and I had enjoy our lunch and highly recommend Chen's Mapo Tofu to anyone who fancy spicy food and satisfy the love of traditional Chinese cuisine."
Chen's Mapo Tofu,"As usual, no staff working, she alone run the whole restaurant. Poor thing. Food is good, but not the small dishes. So, if you go there, order main will be great."
Chen's Mapo Tofu,"Came here for one of my first dine in meals during lunch in CBD - a farewell lunch unfortunately, and was pleasantly surprised by how nice the food is!  :pig: Having not had enough butadon in my recent Japan trip, the pork slice rice immediately caught my eyes. The flavours were good, and portion was generous too.  Tofu was a good find as well, properly spicy at level 1 :thumbs_up_light_skin_tone:  :dumpling: the dumplings were okay, a dish to be ordered in future for sure  Definitely a great find and will be back for more!"
Chen's Mapo Tofu,So delicious. Level 3 spiciness is just right. Tastebuds went boom.  Huge props for providing plant-based mapo tofu options!
Chen's Mapo Tofu,"Food is great but a little pricey. The mapo tofu, their specialty, is obviously great but the other dishes are no slouch. Personally enjoy the Szechuan popcorn chicken dish and the shoya buta noodles."
Chen's Mapo Tofu,"All of the food we ordered is tasty. Portion is reasonable to the price. Had mapo noodle and rice, also mala char Siew noddle which isn’t spicy at all. Mapo noodle however would be able to chose the level of spiciness.  Noodle is tasty and smooth. Fried pop corn chicken is crunchy as well.  Would wish for the spiciness level to be higher.  Went there on a sat evening dinner. Indoor seating is full however out door is empty."
Chen's Mapo Tofu,"Chanced upon this place when looking for dinner options around Star Vista. Tried the signature don (half portion Dan Dan Mian + half portion Mapo Tofu don). Noodles is quite springy and goes well with the minced meat, and peanut broth is very flavourful. Mapo tofu (Level 1 spice) is already spicy enough for most people, and quite strong such that your tongue is numbed. Overall, a decent meal. Portions can be more generous though."
Chen's Mapo Tofu,"Ordered mapo tofu to try since its michelin but disappointed as its too oily. The red chilli oil drip down to all the rice which is below the tofu. They should serve it separately from the rice. There isn't any mince meat, just tofu. I tried level 2 which is too spicy. Tried the don too which is pretty normal but its pricy."
Chen's Mapo Tofu,"First time dining here, enjoyed greatly! Ordered the 1/2 and 1/2 set (soup dan dan mian) with calamansi and popcorn chicken,  plus szechuan dumplings on the side.  The tofu was the highlight for me, flavourful and paired delightfully with the rice it was on. Slightly salty for my own preference, but should be fine for most ppl.  We chose spice level 1 (default) for everything and it was no problem at all. Shouldnt be an issue for anyone unless you totally dont take spice.  Staff friendly and service quick.  Atmosphere nothing to complain about. Casual restaurant style.  Will be back again to try other dishes!"
Chen's Mapo Tofu,"Was unaware of its Michelin star but food was okay. I ordered the spiciest level and strong chilli eater will definitely cruise through. My gripe with it is that there was too little meat. The dan dan noodle is unique and the use of peanut is not prominent which is good. I presume it's Chen Kenichi's brand, thus the Japanese association."
Rachelrax Cakes,"Went to pick up my mini tarts. OK I expected it to be small but didn't expect it to be so small turned out to be quite a surprise. Taste is average, the tart shells seem to look premade. The flavours are interesting and that's just the only hype for me. Pretty nice shop front where almost everything is sold out."
Rachelrax Cakes,"Desert takeaway shop that only has one type of cake! Thought it would surely be good and sure wasn't disappointed. Chocolate mousse cake pairing with a very crunchy biscuit base, also comes in several shapes. Gimmicky yet delicious. However, it can be considered slightly pricey, around $55 for a 5 inch size"
Rachelrax Cakes,I had the orh nee tart in original size and it was average. The orh nee filling was nice but the tart shell was average and crumples easily
Rachelrax Cakes,Dainty. Pretty. Cute tarts. Not sweet. Crunchy crusts. The tarts are filled with lotsa fillings. Love their lychee rose pearls bursting in my mouth. Also the lemon Meringue that has a well balanced citrus and sweet flavour.
Rachelrax Cakes,Desserts are not bad. Pretty colours worth for photo taking
Hamburg Steak Keisuke,The salad bar is excellent. There are six type of sauces which I find the ginger miso is special but a bit weird. Several type of eggs are provided. The coffee pudding is a must try and tasted great with the cream milk. Take not that can only enter the restaurant when all parties in the group are present.
Hamburg Steak Keisuke,"Salad bar 10/10. Really liked the wide selection of items to add into my salad, fruits and coffee jelly was the best. My husband said the highlight of his meal was the coffee jelly.  Hamburg Steak 8/10. Juicy and full of meaty flavour. The bean sprouts tasted a bit raw and the taupok was flavourless and dry.  Triple cheese steak 6/10 as the meat flavour was covered by the cheese. Would not recommend as its 2 dollars more than the regular Hamburg steak"
Hamburg Steak Keisuke,Spent more than an hour waiting in queue. Not quite used to the Hamburg steak though it’s their signature. The salad bar is definitely worth coming back for.
Hamburg Steak Keisuke,"Very good value for money. You get the main course, which largely centred on burger pattie, and it comes with a good spread of salad buffet. The veggies were fresh and they even provided dessert.  They even have freshly made eggs for you. We enjoyed the meal and you could tell the owners put the customers first. It was a good experience."
Hamburg Steak Keisuke,"Salad bar has variety of vegetables for your fibre intake, fruits are also fresh and  I actually like the coffee jelly with coffee cream it’s good. Price is worth it given access to salad bar is free when you order set meal. Hamburg with brown sauce is delicious. Service is good, they are nice. I will go for their Hamburg with brown sauce and coffee jelly with coffee cream when I come again in future. The only downside is aircon leaking at the whole row at the salad bar counter side, the guy beside my table talked about it too, and I’ll choose the seats way behind next time, as the lights at front of the salad bar can be glaring for those seated there. More cozy to sit further from the salad bar."
Mei Kee Bakery,"Spicy Floss seaweed roll bun is tasty guess freshly out from oven as still feel warm.  For pancake (plain), taste nice but on the thin side. Self-add cheese slice."
Mei Kee Bakery,"The variety is okay. Theu actually sell very decent bread and pastries. The reason I give 1-star is because of the Cashier's attitude. She was very very rude, actually rude is an understatement.  Wanted to buy at Waffles at around 8.30pm. (Yes, I agree the timing is late). I understand maybe they are closing up already, but the way she turn us away was very rude. The cashier is also the lady who makes the waffles. I was looking at the list of waffles, then she told me in a very rude tone in Chinese. ""Waffle no more sold out already."" When I could clearly see one tub of batter there and waffles still being cooked. My Mom then ask politely upon seeing this, she asked - Is the plain one avalible? She then replied in a even ruder and loud tone saying in Chinese - ""Already say don't have already all no more already. No more""  A simple - ""Sorry we are closed already"" or ""I cleaning up would have sufficed"". If this is the way your are, word if advice, not happy, DON'T WORK HERE, WE NO NEED YOUR STINKING ATTITUDE. Treat others the way you want to be treated, especially if you are in the F&B Line.  Also heard from others they had same experience with the same person."
Mei Kee Bakery,"The yam bun paste is sour, wasted $1.60."
Mei Kee Bakery,"I used to buy from this stall but today I went to the shop and was turned off by how rude is this cashier . She is literally so rude. If not happy please don’t work . Poor aunty , she is a paying customer but this cashier treated her as beggar . I got the same feedback from my mother as well when I told her."
Mei Kee Bakery,Not bad waffles are good so are their buns and pastries.
Mei Kee Bakery,Love their chicken shao bao. Semi-soft crusty outer layer with creamy chicken char siew filling. Yum.
Mei Kee Bakery,"Tried out the Yam Paste tart today. Althought it taste alright, the texture and colour of the yam paste seems not make from 100% yam."
Mei Kee Bakery,Chicken char siew shao bao. Good for breakfast.
Mei Kee Bakery,"Newly open at bus interchange. Tried the apple tart, char siew and red bean paste pastries."
Mei Kee Bakery,Can please indicate your operating hours? Went there this afternoon at 1pm but it was closed.
Mei Kee Bakery,"$6 for 6 regular sized tau sah piah. Get to choose btw 8 flavours. Tried coffee :thumbs_up_light_skin_tone:, savoury shrimp Haebeehiam, red bean, usual suspects of salty & sweet green bean. An arm of Bakery Cuisine bakery so you might see similar/ familiar breads & cakes from their main brand.  Located near T3 connector walkway to Jewel :gem_stone:"
Mei Kee Bakery,Located near T3 connector walkway to Jewel Must try
Mei Kee Bakery,"First, they just “pour” out the pastries that were just freshly baked from the oven, look at the mess of pastries. This showed that they do not take pride in what they sell. Second, the thick is very thick and half baked, can taste the powdery flour. It cause a person to easily  choke as it is very lumpy. The ang ku kueh with yam filling, the yam filling is not even fully cooked as the yam tasted raw. What is this bakery selling? Half cooked pastries? Half cooked food?"
Mei Kee Bakery,Bought a small kaya bun and it was great! Humble bakery and good tasting!
Mei Kee Bakery,Staff was rude and impatient. Not to mention the limited choices..  All the pastries seem not freshly baked. definitely not a place to get your traditional fix of pastries.
Mei Kee Bakery,"Update: Bought the sweet Tau Shar Piah on Monday 10/4/2023. The standard drop so fast? Taste drop, filling inside drop but the outer skin (crust) up . Crust become thicker... Disappointed... Still give 3 stars, as so far the staffs are friendly.  ______ Like their Tau Shar Piah 豆沙饼. Crispy outer crust. Ate it the next day still has some crispy. Although it not cheap, but much cheaper than some brand."
Mei Kee Bakery,Variety of cakes available.
Chef Goo,"Don’t be confused by the wide array of items on their menu, the star dish remains to be the fried Hokkien mee. The umami-filled broth is infused with the flavours of the sea and smoke, and fresh sweet prawns, pork slices, and clams cooked nicely with a healthy serving of noodles."
Chef Goo,"Stock is flavourful, will soaked into the noodles. There's much ingredients like prawns, lala, meats. (Ignore the sliced fish and dumpling, they were from another stall)  Plenty of strong smokey wok hei, even some burnt bits.  Overall can eat!"
Chef Goo,"Ordered the Red Sea Prawn Hokkien Mee $6.90 and the Braised Pork Belly Bee Hoon ($10.90 to $13.90) due to a newspaper article written on this hawker stall a while ago. The Chef Goo sign is no longer there but replaced with the signature dishes photos and name.  The Positives...the quantity is good for the price paid. The ingredients are also good and not stingy. Minimal salt used...can be a good or bad thing depending on your taste buds. My wife likes it bland, so it's good for her. For me, no salt or low salt also means no kick from umami and lacking taste.  The Bad. 1. The hokkien mee had a smokey flavour but it doesn't taste like 'wok hei'. The smokey flavour tastes like ashes from a cigarette bud. Hope this don't offend the chef but that's what I tasted. To be fair to the chef, he was not smoking at that time.  2. The newspaper article wrote about the signature braised pork leg Bee Hoon about how the braised pork leg was stewed for many hours to obtain the old time taste & flavour. Just before serving, I saw the chef pour a can of narcissus braised pork into the Bee Hoon mix. I'm greatly disappointed with the use of canned food.  Not recommended."
Chef Goo,"There have been mixed reviews for the Hokkien mee sold here.  Today I decided to tar pow 2 bowls of the noodles, which were consumed some 3.5 hrs after it was cooked.  I found it very good and they were generous with the prawns, lala and pork belly. The chilli provided was also good.  If the stock used could be more flavourful, I would rate it 5 stars.  The Hokkien mee was great value for money for me.  Will definitely come back to try the other dishes."
Chef Goo,"A very flavorful version of fried prawn noodles that suits my taste rather perfectly. I tabao from Chef Goo a few times a week. The only improvement I could suggest is the slightly sandy lala, which I do not know if anything could be done. Also, I usually opt for no pork. I've no comments on the environment because I prefer to eat it at home. Please keep up the good work, Chef"
Mama Curry,"I had Mee Siam which was not bad, but thought I should eat Indian food. The waiter was smiling all the time he served to me. Happy experience."
Mama Curry,Mutton is good and tasty
Mama Curry,The chicken is hard as a rock... They fry it like this morning and serve it to you... Not recomended
Mama Curry,Horrible service. Had order 2 bru coffees...they gave kopi see and said bru. Come on least add the milk and make thr looks convincing.
Mama Curry,Food was amazing. I wish I could eat everything on the menu. :smiling_face_with_heart-eyes::smiling_face_with_heart-eyes::smiling_face_with_heart-eyes:
Mama Curry,Delicious . Homemade taste and lady boss changed variety of dishes daily . Curry is not overly spicy too .  Note that though 9am open .. sometimes more dishes will be available from 10am onwards .. and closed at 3pm and when dishes sold out .  Ladyboss is doing everything by herself . No stall asistant . Just herself . Very friendly . Any dietary preferences can let her know . :smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes:  Enquire and got to know just open for 1 month plus . #02-09  Sambal prawn set $6 Asam fish set $6 Curry chicken set $5.5 Cuttlefish set $5.5 Fried wings set $4.5 Premium set $10.5  * Note this is not a halal stall .  Very hard to find such good prices nowadays .
Mama Curry,"I decided to lunch here for the first time. I'll definitely be back. The staff are friendly, and food is delicious. Bhasmathi rice with great tasting side dishes and ingredients are fresh. Simple and tasty."
Mama Curry,
Mama Curry,
Mama Curry,"The food is moderate.  But the shop is dishonest. The staff charge us higher than what is clearly stated on menu 17% higher. When confronted, he made up excuse price has increased. Please double check before ordering.  * Briyani chicken ($6 on menu, charged $7) taste 3/5 * Teh ais taste 1/5 (way too sweet, i ended up having to buy extra water to dilute it)"
Mama Curry,"Ordered mee goreng chicken, prata egg, teh halia.  Mee goreng is too spicy & salty with only 3-4 slices of chicken, is different from the usual Indian food shop which will give a piece of fried chicken chopped eg drumstick, wing or thigh. Gave up after eating only 1/2, too spicy and salty.  Prata egg looks good come with dhal. Yet to eat at this point of review, will update  Teh halia is the saving grace to this meal order. Awesome tea."
Mama Curry,"Mama's corner was operating past 2 years, Halal food. Near open space car park. 47 Sims Place."
Mama Curry,Mama’s Corner replaced Nineties. Tried it for the first time and we loved the mutton briyani and the coin prata. The rice for the briyani is good for 2 pax and the coin prata is crispy yet dense and tasty. Enjoyed both.
Mama Curry,"Had their rice with fried chicken, portion is generous, curries were delicious, fried chicken was good. Teh halia wasn't too spicy and quite milky with good ginger taste. Plain prata and cheese egg mushrooms prata were freshly cooked and fluffy as well. Will return to try their other items"
Mama Curry,Truly a great place to buy briyani. Had the chicken rendang and it was so flavourful. Not too strong but has enough oomph. The chicken was very well cooked and tender and all in all  an enjoyable experience. Being in Old Airport at the back of the first row of stalls facing the road. In terms of car park...plenty. only grouse is the cleaniness of Old Airport. Compared to Tiong Bahru...a but dirty.
Mama Curry,Delicious biryani rice and assam for the pricing. Would return in the future :) Keep it up!
Mama Curry,"Ordered both chicken rendang and fried chicken and they were so good! Especially the fried chicken! Super big piece. Rendang was tasty too, just that the gravy was too little as compared to the ratio of the rice served."
Mama Curry,"Although run by Chinese, this place has all the makings of a good briyani. Fragrant briyani rice, succulent, juicy meats, and achar.And it's at a very affordable price."
Mama Curry,Amazing value and tasty thick cut chicken cutlet
Mama Curry,"Mama spice is the source of many of my gifting and I’m confident it will Wow my recipients as it has always wowed me with their tasty puffs, spicy and flavourful curry. The Heh Bee Hiam is also heavenly."
Mama Curry,Curry puffs and Curry Chicken with potatoes and fried mantou are WOW and so appetising and delicious. Straightaway eat while hot and crispy Curry puffs. Thanks Koh's Family for the nice gifts celebrated yesterday's Happy Father's Day!
Mama Curry,"Food is really good, curry is not too spicy and the gravy goes well with the mantou! Strongly recommend this store!! :)"
Mama Curry,"These crispy, fragrant and delicious curry puffs are 100% handmade from scratch. The skin isn’t too thick and comes with generous amount of fillings. Simply airfry to enjoy them warm. I love that it comes in a size that’s perfect for a light tea break. :smiling_face_with_heart-eyes:"
Mama Curry,"Curry was a crowd pleaser; generous portions with meat and potatoes, great for a family meal or party. Cycled there to collect and appreciated that the items were all packed nicely with cling wrap and double bagged. My favourite was the curry puffs, these had thin / crispy crust packed with ingredients, and a delight to eat. Most importantly, not overly oily or salty without compromising on taste. Definitely will repurchase!"
Mama Curry,"Chanced upon this selling curry on Social media. Came here the following day for lunch and decided to give this stall a try. The stall is located on the 2nd level of the food centre and they are located opposite the popular Glutinous Rice Balls stall. Apparently this stall is affiliated to a well known stall curry stall in Bedok. There wasn't any queue while i was there and was able to order immediately. Apart from the chicken curry, they also serves vegetable and fish head curry.  Ordered the SGD$5.50 portion with an additional rice, paid SGD$6 for my meal. Curry was thick and spicy. it comes with potato, chicken wing and a piece of thigh meat. Gravy is actually not bad but the portion was a little for SGD$5.50. If you don't want rice, they do have baguette available.  Overall, food was okay but slightly pricy for me."
Mama Curry,"super good!!! had the fish head curry and it was so tender, not too spicy and went super well with the rice. my friend and i are usually not a fan of curry but found myself coming back again the following week :) - do come earlier to get your curry fix as they mostly sell out around 7:30pm!"
Mama Curry,Love the curry here. It is very similar to the famous Na Na Curry. I am glad I don't need to travel all the way to the West to enjoy my favorite Na Na Curry. Will definitely order again at Ma Ma Curry.
Mama Curry,$6 for these. In e bowl there’s some potatoes and only 1 chicken wing and a small piece of chicken said to be thigh… omg it’s not very nice and I felt ripped off.
Mama Curry,"Dabao-ed 3 packs for my family - Chicken , mutton and vege curry . The thick and spicy curry broth is the star here, portion of the chicken was big and filling . ( the chicken drum and thigh set ) . Mutton was not gamey and nicely diced . My mum love the vege curry the best . Highly recommend to drip the curry sauce with bread ! :smiling_face_with_hearts: can’t wait to try their curry fish head next time !"
Hello Arigato Everton Park,"Charming cafe, with few indoor seats. Props to them providing portable little fans for the folks seated outside, and braving Singapore's sweltering heat.  :maple_leaf: Maple Bacon milk doughnuts (3/5) Arrived at 3pm, and there were few donuts left. Donut was savoury, soft, chewy, but cold. Unfortunately, as it was not reheated, the texture of the breadcrumbs felt lacklustre, the cream and bacon filling was cloying. Congealed bacon grease is not good. Disappointing.  :honeybee: Honeycomb Latte (5/5) Absolutely delightful! Latte was very good, and topped with generous pieces of crispy honeycomb. Great balance of fragrance, and acidity."
Hello Arigato Everton Park,"Great new spot in the area. I thoroughly enjoyed the curry donut and the milk donut that I sampled.  A bit pricier, but the curry was good quality and had a strong meaty flavour I liked.  Will definitely make it part of the regular rotation. Hope you guys make it a long time in this location!"
Hello Arigato Everton Park,"We ordered 3 Sandos, 5 donuts, a tater tots and 2 coffees and they were all fantastic. The coffee wasn’t too acidic which is to my liking. What really stood out was the whisky bbq katsu (Everton park exclusive)! It was juicy yet cruchy and the taste was very robust. I honestly didn’t think that I would be full from eating sandwiches but I was wrong cause the portion was really generous. Would definitely come back again for more! :thumbs_up:"
Hello Arigato Everton Park,"A new artisanal coffee joint that opened next door to the well established Nylon Cafe at the Everton Park enclave. Came here for coffee break and the white coffee taste just right, the cream-filled donut paired well with the coffee. A pleasant afternoon delight which we are highly recommended if you are here."
Hello Arigato Everton Park,"Having a small meeting before a big day ahead  We order some hot coffee latte and hot tea.  Ambiance is great and cozy, staff is really helpful and attentive.  My coffee taste great and full of aroma."
Kuan Zhai Alley,"Overrated restaurant!  Ordered golden shrimp balls ($58), 酸菜鱼($88)、辣子鸡 ($38) and 2 rice. Golden shrimp balls’ presentation was good, taste was ok 酸菜鱼was just spicy, lack of sour note Be warned that the some fish slices still with long bone yet the chef could missed that out. I won’t recommend 辣子鸡, chicken was cut into very small pieces and fried till dry, even the peanut was bigger than the chicken  Total damage $224 for 3 dishes and 2 rice. I was given a voucher for free dish with one month validity, but I won’t visit again."
Kuan Zhai Alley,"Signature dish - Braised Fish with Sour Cowpea was stunning to look at - as if the fish was swimming in boiling chili gravy inside the pot. The fish was delicious and fairly sizable, sufficient for 4 pax. Other tasty dishes included deep fried pop corn chicken with chili and mapo bean curd. The food was good but not outstanding with a corresponding price tag of >SGD100/pax."
Kuan Zhai Alley,"This Sichuan restaurant positions itself as an upscale dining option, with unique presentation, but the taste does not live up to expectations. The service is great, and the ambiance is cozy and clean. The Sichuan dish with sour pickled fish is enjoyable, but beware of the bones. The famous spicy fried chicken dish is a letdown, with an overload of chili and peanuts and little chicken, making it less spicy and rather bland. The traditional saliva chicken served two ways is unique but lacks flavor. The boiled belly pork with lots of garlic sauce is delicious, and the fried pig intestine pairs well with beer. Unfortunately, the spicy Sichuan dumplings are dry and have thick dough skin, while the Dan Dan noodles are even more disappointing, as there is not enough sauce to blend with the noodles. The dessert is terrible, with only half being consumed. The marinated jellyfish with black vinegar is appetizing but challenging to pick up from the bowl. The special prawn with salted egg is yummy, and the vegetables are a standout dish. At $8 per person, the cost is ridiculous, with the food being expensive compared to similar options, where you could pay 50% less. The total bill of $528 for five people, with an $88 fish dish, is quite expensive."
Kuan Zhai Alley,"Many empty tables for a sun lunch. Came here for a lunch date with my husband. Choices in the menu wasn't a lot as compare to other China restaurant that we used to patron. Couldn't justified much for other dishes as we only had three dish. One of it would be their signature fish which is priced at 168. Overall, it all tasted pretty good but it could be similar to the taste you can get at some good China restaurants which comes at a more affordable price. Would say that the food isn't worth for the price. Prices on each item was pretty much overpriced as compare to any China restaurant out there. Would not revisit. Definitely impeccable service and place does look nice located at the heart of the cbd."
Kuan Zhai Alley,"Fine dining with Sichuan cuisines! Super impressed with their creative and beautiful plating and good services! (We saw many other beautiful plating on other tables.) Prices are on the pricey side, but it comes with free flow of Pu'er or crysanthmum tea, and wet towels are not chargeable. Lovely ambience but I felt the aircon can be colder as I felt it was quite stuffy."
Whisking Bakes,"I had the chance to visit this cafe after lunch on a weekday and it was a quiet affair. Shortly after I sat down, a few more groups came in probably wanting a place to relax before heading back to office.  The cafe was bigger than expected, and has a variety of seating area from sofas, to countertops looking outside to normal table and chairs. I would think it would make a good place to do some work even.  The cafe seems to specialize mainly in taro incorporated products. I had the taromisu which I saw on social media, and it tasted as good as it looks. While there seems to not have any coffee like the usual tiramisu, the taro flavor was pronounced and if you enjoy such flavors you’ll definitely like it. As a post lunch snack however, it was rather heavy and took me awhile to finish. Nonetheless I enjoyed it very much. For the quality and the nice decor, I consider the price to be pretty reasonable ($7.50). Would consider coming back to try more of their cakes and pastries!"
Whisking Bakes,"A great little shop for a girl's afternoon tea, not too big, with a nice quiet environment for conversation. The prices are not very high, around S$15 per person, no GST or service charge. I went early in the morning and didn't get the signature puffs, but the Taromisu was very good! It's not too sweet, and the coffee is super tasty, with a taro milk cap on top."
Whisking Bakes,"Drinks and food are average cafe price, however they don’t charge extra for changing to oat milk which I really appreciate! Not sure what brand they use (oatside?) but it was very rich, creamy and fragrant which I liked a lot. Some might find the coffee slightly weak, but I guess that has to do with the beans or extraction. Cozy atmosphere. Wifi and some charging points available. Water provided for self-service too"
Whisking Bakes,Taro Swiss roll with mochi $6.50  A small homely cafe. Almost everything on the menu is taro related! The concept of this cake is nice but it will be nicer if the cake roll is fluffier and the mochi can be softer. Will be back for other bakes!
Whisking Bakes,Delicious cakes and cute cafe! Worth visit if you’re in the area and went to the Michelin star pork noodle star next door! The are known for the taro flavored cakes. Signature is: Taro-misu
Jtown Cafe,Introduced to this Indonesian Bakmie (noodles) by an ex-colleague years ago and I’m happy to know that it’s still operating!  Good quality chicken and noodles used to make their dishes and flavour is authentic too!  Today’s noodles were a little over cooked and the flavour is still there. They offer sweet black sauce for the true blue Indonesians who love them with their bakmie!
Jtown Cafe,"Sedap martabak manis! Not the healthiest I know, but once in a while OK lah. Just take black tea after, without sugar. Smaller in size than others in the vicinity, but priced accordingly. More buttery, and equally messy. Lezat! Have yet to try their other food dishes."
Jtown Cafe,"It is said that money can’t buy happiness, but at JTown, it costs me less than $10. The crispy chicken and aromatic sambal belado that pairs in perfect harmony, the warm fluffy murtabak, the fried dumplings that remind you of home, and the warm Indonesian hospitality that almost always grants me an extra bowl of their addictive soup. Money can’t buy happiness, but JTown sure puts a smile on my face."
Jtown Cafe,Cheaper food option with good quality in Orchard. (About $7-$8/main course)  Bakmi’s chilli is very shiok. The noodles itself a bit soft to me.  Batagor is a bit special to me. I don’t think I could find the “tofu” :grinning_face_with_sweat: But taste not that bad actually.
Jtown Cafe,"The chicken tasted so good, crispy on the outside while tender in the inside. The chicken was also well seasoned. The noodles were springy. Would highly recommend this place and come back again."
Shuang Bao Thai,"Ordered the basil minced pork rice and thai milk tea.. there is a promotional set at $9 but the person who key in the order didn’t bother to inform customer, and charged me separately. Didn’t even bother to do any service recovery just said that bcos I ordered separately and not order set meal so have to charge separately as well. What logic is that?"
Shuang Bao Thai,"The pork belly rice is really good and worth. Previously ordered the chicken skin as well and it was really good. However, this time ordered the pork belly rice again but the portion for the pork seems lesser. But overall still very nice."
Shuang Bao Thai,Super like the chicken wing . Delicious And the staff also very affable & hardworking :red_heart:
Shuang Bao Thai,
Shuang Bao Thai,"Very polite service and the crispy pork was fantastic (advice to get more than 100g). The whole purchase experience was pleasant. The lady refunded us the take away cost when we told them we did not want dapao and wanted to eat there, eventhough she has already put all the food into containers."
Shuang Bao Thai,"Found this hole in the wall outlet in Bedok Center selling Hat Yai Thai food instead of your run of the mill Pad Thai. It was helmed by two Thai ladies so this must be authentic Thai food. With that thought, I bought their Fried Chicken Rice ($4.80) and Fried Chicken Skin ($3.60).  The chicken rice is not like any other types of chicken rice in Singapore. Visually it looked like the version you can get in Bangkok from Bib Gourmand winner Polo Fried Chicken. But unfortunately taste wise, it is nowhere near. The rice was basically soya sauce, lemon grass and some other spices. No taste of chicken. The fried chicken, which came topped with fried shallots, was dry like tree bark. I assure you that you can get better ones from pasar malam. The saving grace was the sweet and tangy chilli sauce which caused me to salivate more and perhaps made swallowing easier.  The fried chicken skin was biscuit like crispy. But it had some strange funky taste like unwashed meat. I gave up at the third piece and threw away the rest.  Won’t be returning. By the way I discovered that they charged me 20cents more for food container even though I dined in."
Shuang Bao Thai,"Excellent and tasty fried chicken. The sinful fried chicken skin is very addictive but the best of the lot is the fried pork belly. However the pork belly is very pricy at $4.50 per 100g. The quality and taste can rival that of Jollibee or Popeyes, but almost certainly better than KFC."
Shuang Bao Thai,"I came for the fried chicken! This flavor is bit diffrent from others; more garlicky taste. Sure is crispy, but a bit on the dry side. Served by Thai counter but the guy speak English. If you love super crispy fried chicken and the crispy skin this place is the one. They sell other fried skins too!  They also added shallots to my chickens.  Current gripe is the meal comes with sticky rice, they do not mix well.  Mango salad side dish boosts your appetite and is nice and they added some fried anchovies (my first time seeing fried anchovies on mango salad ) but they use chilli padi to make. Better sieve them out before you eat! Because of the sticky rice, its quite filling. Worth the price.  Also remember to take your cutlery.  Will come back to try their other menus including mango sticky rice! :grinning_squinting_face:  Update. MANGO STICKY RICE IS SO GOOD!!! But it depend on availability of ripe mango. So ask before you purchase will be good,"
Shuang Bao Thai,Fried Chicken Skin + Fried Pork Belly. Will we start seeing more Thai street food stalls in Singapore?  Honestly their offering could be an alternative to the Taiwan fried chicken stalls!
Black Fairy,"I had the beef stew for brunch. It is so soft and tender it’s super good. I didn’t give a full 5 stars because I’ve only tried 1 dish there. The coffee is also good, 1 of the better ones I’ve had on my visit to Singapore that weekend, at least no complain from me. :thumbs_up_light_skin_tone:"
Black Fairy,"Went for a late lunch and had a fantastic beef stew. Beef was made just right, not too raw and not overcooked and paired perfectly with the ciabatta bread. My partner loves her seafood stew as well. We loved the Mala Shimeiji mushroom as a side as well. Thier signature coffees, Popcorn Latte and Cafe Mocha had the right amount of coffee and was not overly sweet, which I really liked. Will come back again :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes:! For those driving, park near the cafe along the main road as the small road behind the cafe is closed."
Black Fairy,Nice ambient place. Coffee alcohol and dessert plus food provided. Non vegetarian mostly seafood too. The cafe looks interesting. Lots of seating available. I believe they do do catering too. Green tea very thick and coffee not bad they do good patterns too on the coffee. Cheese cake not as nice in a glass.
Black Fairy,We had a delicious brunch in this cute place! The portion is very generous and they let us tweak our dishes which was really appreciated! Would have been perfect if they served fresh juices.
Black Fairy,"Very nice place to chill and have a meal or just coffee! Their menu has options for both brunch and mains.  My friend and I had the Salmon with Mango, Smoked Salmon Eggs Benedict, Soy Chicken, Yuzu Lemon Fizz and an Iced Latte.  The mains were quite good, the mango sauce takes the cake for the salmon. Surprisingly paired well with the salmon. The soy chicken was definitely worth trying. However, overall feel that the portions could be slightly larger for the price paid, especially for the Soy Chicken which was a side meant for sharing.  The place is spacious, could seat about 30+ people both indoor and outdoor. Very well designed as well for the small space. Has the vibes for a mini hangout at a cafe.  Overall would rate it 4-stars, with 1-star being lost on portion size for price paid."
Geylang (Hamids) Briyani Stall,I always come here whenever I want a plate of comforting mutton briyani. The quality of their mutton is to me the best I have eaten - so tender and flavourful. So satisfying after eating each and every time.
Geylang (Hamids) Briyani Stall,"Was drawn by the many reviews to this briyani store. However, the experience was lackluster, the mutton was too small a serving and quite tough. The dahl was thick but had one dimensional flavour."
Geylang (Hamids) Briyani Stall,"  Edit:  Finally got to dine in here and tried the Ayam goreng and mutton options. Mutton was flavourful but a little dry and tough. The Ayam goreng was great. It wasn’t particularly crispy but it was packed full of flavour from the marinade. Meat was tender too - impressive!  The rice on its own isn’t actually very fragrant. With the masala, it’s great. The dhal this time is much more balanced in favours too. For this visit, plum pickle was provided. It brought a sense of fruitiness and sweetness to the dish - seemingly replacing the role that raisins would normally play in traditional briyani. This was a relatively good experience overall. 5 stars.  -  This is my first visit to this popular biryani stall. As it was during P2HA, I had to takeaway. But as we all know, biryani to go will still taste good, if not even better.  I got home and was pleased that the biryani was still warm. For two portions of mutton biryani, it came with one bag of dahl. Dahl wasn’t particularly good in my opinion, not a fan. The rice was light and fragrant. The masala gravy delicious. Mutton tender but just a bit gamier than I like it, but still good. Flavours are a little sweeter due to the plums(?) instead of raisins used.  I was keen to try the Ayam goreng but that was unavailable at around 1pm on a Saturday. The regular Ayam was not available too, but a new batch was being prepared then. Do come earlier to have a wider variety to choose from."
Geylang (Hamids) Briyani Stall,"Came here having heard the hype and some coverage on a local channel.  There was a long queue, at least 15-20 minutes. Uncle is very kind and patient.  However, the biryani doesn’t live up to its hype. The chicken piece was quite small and not tasty. The rice is ok, not flavourful. The dhal doesn’t add anything to the dish, in fact makes it worse."
Geylang (Hamids) Briyani Stall,Ordered Chicken and Mutton Briyani and the Mutton Briyani is awesome.  Not sure if the rice is too little or the Mutton is just too good that I gobbled every grain of rice. :face_with_tears_of_joy:  Try to go early as it sells out fast and mutton sells out even faster. Was in queue at around 1pm and manage to snatch the last few plates of mutton.  Prepare to queue during lunch hours but they are quite fast in serving.
Friends Kitchen HK,Welcomed warmly by the service staff into the restaurant. :hundred_points:  We ordered milk tea (both cold and hot). Personally I prefer the cold milk tea. It wasn't too sweet but sweet enough for my liking..  We ordered the french toast and baked pork chop rice to share. The french toast came piping hot with a generous spread of peanut butter. We could also drizzle honey syrup onto the taste. It was so enjoyable. I will definitely recommend this. :face_savoring_food::smiling_face_with_open_hands:  The baked pork rice came slightly later. I guess it needed more time. It was ok.  Looking forward to trying other food items on the menu. :thumbs_up:
Friends Kitchen HK,"On 7 July 2023, I went to that cafe to try out new cafe. I ordered hot milk tea and baked cheese rice and my experience to it was mid.  The hot milk tea was not meeting my expectations as it did not taste sweet. But since there was no added sugar for that milk tea, I requested to have sugar so that it suited my tastebud.  The baked cheese rice was acceptable but expensive,the rice was not mixed evenly with the tomato sauce. The meat was good and it met my expectations on the baked cheese rice.  Overall, I may come back to try out dim sum as well as dessert, but not very often. However, the atmosphere was good and service was reasonable."
Friends Kitchen HK,"The food is OK, I'll say average, but this place is very photogenic! My chicken chop in the sizzling hot plate is actually nice and crispy,  but the white rice is just plain white rice - it's in fact served separately and not in the hot plate. I think it would have been nicer if they had a baked chicken rice option. The polo bun, ee foo noodle were all quite average but priced on the high end. The pork baked rice have bones btw, prefer if it were removed first,  but at least the baked rice is better than white rice.  The surroundings however was quite photogenic. Feels like a beautiful private house. We took lots of photos in the garden settings and at the stairs.  Hope the food improves the next time we come!"
Friends Kitchen HK,"Had almost everything recommend on the menu! The noodles were one of the highlights, the broth left us wanting more. The wasabi’s pork dish was really tender. The vegetable was cook just like how my mom would make it.  Would definitely come down for the noodles again. The atmosphere is really unique. We didn’t have any drinks but the prices for the tower were really cheap at $55 for a 3L tower (Heineken/Guinness)"
Friends Kitchen HK,"Bookmarked their restaurant for a long time but their first shop is too far for me, finally they opened this new branch which is so easy to get to!  Food was impressive!!! Everything is authentic and tasty, it’s the taste of my childhood:face_holding_back_tears: Thank you for serving great food! It means a lot to the HKers living in Singapore! Hope everyone will enjoy their food too 開新店加油!會多啲黎幫襯:beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes:  PS 老闆娘is so nice and pretty! Keep asking if everything is good. It issss!!:thumbs_up_medium_skin_tone:"
Ka-Soh,Came here because the original outlet at Amoy Street that I usually frequent was closed. The sliced fish noodle and the prawn paste chicken tasted just as good as always.  Also ordered sea cucumber & black bean source sliced fish with bitter gourd and they were amazing.  Have frequented these place several times. Only drawback is that parking space is limited.
Ka-Soh,"Soup seems thicker and much more flavorful before when they were located in town, it's now much more diluted and those fish slices are no more slippery like last time, they're now chor-chor dry-dry very coarse."
Ka-Soh,"Food was alright, fish was fresh but soup was nothing fantastic. Service was very bad. Server was very impatient when ordering and gave attitude when asked for more details. He also missed out 2 of our orders. Will not come again.  I have also uploaded the photo of the server. Visited 11/01/2023, 7.15pm. please retrain the server"
Ka-Soh,"First time trying this branch on a weekend dinner time. Not crowded when i arrived. Renovation is normal. I dont enjoy the customer service, dont feel welcome and seem abit impatient when taking order (when it is not crowded). Ordered 2 mains + 1 side. The portion and price are decent. I didnt like the taste of the fish soup bee hoon here, felt the standard dropped abit but the prawn paste chicken still taste good and i will still strongly recommend that as a side. Would recommend my friends to try different branch to see if the taste is the same."
Ka-Soh,"Tried the deep fried frog leg and it was superb! Love the fried ginger that went along with it. Had the sliced fish bee hoon soup, doneness of bee hoon was good, soup was soothing to have. And if you love yam, you must MUST try their fried orh nee!! Still thinking about it right now haha"
Ka-Soh,"This restaurant (Ka-Soh in Outram) will be closing this Sunday 26 June 2022 and I need to visit it one last time before the closure of this outlet. Their traditional Cantonese-Style Fish Bee Hoon Soup is a MUST-ORDER as the color of the milky white broth is achieved without any evaporated milk! My favourite is the prawn paste chicken, best in SG!!! They do have other popular dishes such as Fried You Mai Vegetables with Dace Fish, Sweet and Sour Pork, San Lao Hor Fun, etc. The service of this restaurant is good and the service staff are very friendly. This restaurant will be highly recommended if you want to bring your family for a great dinner. You may visit them at their other outlet at 22 Greenwood Avenue."
Ka-Soh,"It was a below average dinner experience. The Ah Cha (pickled vegetables) appetizer, which was not complementary, arrived first but we found it was infested with ants! The staff promptly removed it and replaced with a new plate with no apologies. Ordered the signature fish slice noodle soup and prawn paste chicken wings and found it was below average in my opinion. You are better off with sliced fish soup from other restaurants. Will not recommend."
Ka-Soh,"My son suggested we dined at Ka-Soh Restaurant in the Alumni Association at College Road as it was the last day the restaurant would operate there (since 2007).  Our family had always enjoyed their fish fillet noodle soup, Har Geong Gai (Prawn Paste Chicken) and Tofu with fresh crab meat, besides other dishes. Hence, we ordered only these three items. Like comfort food for us.  Spoke to waitresses and proprietor in between our meals. Apparently, one of the chef is leaving, and it was difficult to secure replacement.  The proprietor had evaluated the feasibility of staying in the same premises, but as the building was very old, the air conditioning system needed to be replaced. And there’s plan for the Alumni Building to be pulled down (don’t know the date) so it wasn’t appropriate to put in heavy investment into the premises at this stage.  Proprietor thanked us for our support over the years and hope that we can continue to patronize them at the remaining restaurant at Greenwood."
Ka-Soh,I truly missed my Amoy street ka soh . This one only made 50% of the cut. The flexibility of the stuff here is not as good as the original one. Everything has to be ask before it's given. Ok fish soup forget about it . It's only 50% nice than the past.  This is a little fishy here. Go for ha cheong chicken and black bean sauce hor fun still as great.  The rest are so so . I love it's not really crowded and rustic settings . It's quiet in this location. A decent place for a not too high expectations meal.
Ka-Soh,"My first visit was years ago at Amoy Street’s outlet. This year, for my birthday, I decided to visit Swee Kee Fish Head Noodle House at College Road. My family walked into the clubhouse, feeling like the 1980s, and found Ka-Soh Restaurant on the furthest right hand side. Compared to the Amoy Street outlet, the College Road branch felt like a throwback to Chinese restaurants of yesteryears, with simple furniture and old-school tablecloths.  Pickles ($2.50) The pickles were served before the food came. It was really appetising.  Fish Fillet Noodle Soup ($28) I ordered the Fish Fillet instead of Fish Slice, as I had the Fish Slice before. Fish Fillet is thicker and meatier. The soup is paired with simple ingredients of white rice noodles and crunchy vegetables, and you could taste traces of wine that made it more uplifting. I was a fan of the soup which wasn’t too intense or ‘fake-tasting’ (as they don’t add evaporated milk), like it was full of natural goodness.  Sliced Fish Noodle ($8) Grandmother was not a fan of the soup as she said this was too bland. She had to put quite abit of soy sauce & chilli. But she did not managed to finish. NOTE: Grandmother is a big eater, so this was quite surprising.  Spare Pork Ribs ($18) They use more premium items like kurobuta pork to make their signature pork chops.  Honestly I wouldn’t be able to tell the difference since the meat has been marinated and deep fried.  It still has that sweetish savoury flavour and unlike the typical pork chops, there is a sweet sauce to go with it  Kang Kong with Sambal ($14) Kang Kong with sambal never goes wrong, well balanced and cook. Nothing amazing so price is considered high for average taste.  Beansprout with salted fish ($16) Not a big fan of beansprout & salted fish, but gave it a try. Price is too costly for the cheap ingredients. Nothing fanciful to talk about, would have preferred more kangkong if I were to order more vegetable.  Hong Kong Kailan with mushroom ($18) Simple & tasty vegetables. Nothing wrong about it, but price is higher than the previous 2 vegetable fishes which I’ve ordered. Would not order this again.  Tea ($6) Nothing particular about the tea, but price is good for a pot to go well with a meal for Chinese people!  Overall The food at Ka Soh is good and they do make the effort to make all their sauces and soup stocks themselves.  You will have a satisfying zi char meal there if you walked in without any expectations & is okay with the price.  Total Cost $158.31 (6 pax)"
Supercurry,"This place was featured by MTC together with AC, and I decided to give it a shot despite quite a few not too great comments.  Despite having some ‘set’ items, they are essentially a caifan stall. I’m not sure if the set item provide any discount but if there’s an item I’m not too keen in then I would just go ala carte which was what I did. I ordered 5 items: fried chicken, braised cabbage, brinjal, fried egg and curry chicken thigh. Total came up to $10. The chicken curry thigh itself was $3.  Taste wise, I agree w the comments, something just wasn’t there with the taste. Did they forget the seasoning? They did add too little spice? I’m not sure. But maybe it might not be a bad thing.  Curry was thick and creamy. Brinjal was perfectly soft. Chicken cutlet was meaty and very crispy, not your usual curry png stall batter, it felt more of a Malay style fried chicken. Cabbage wasn’t the braised until super soft kind, there was still quite a bite. The curry chicken on the other hard was pretty tough, as if it was left overnight kind and became over cooked.  I came around 11am and after some time the lunch crowd came in. It was clear that this stall wasn’t the popular choice. That went to the vegetarian/mala stall on its left followed by the nasi lemak stall or its right."
Supercurry,"The queue for Supercurry was not as long as the other stalls in the vicinity so we decided to give it a try given that there seems to be a number of accolades for this stall.  Owner was friendly, and I must say the creamy curry sauce is quite unique.  Ordered curry chicken , eggs and taupok (1 piece) for $5. Not the most value for money for sure, but it's a decent meal to have if you are around the area."
Supercurry,Chicken cutlet was crispy. curry surprisingly spicy and milky. if the curry was more warm would be much better.
Supercurry,"arrived at about 230pm, most things were sold out. wanted to try the braised chicken but had to settle for minced beef curry instead. was also hoping to try the omelette but it was also sold out. overall food was delicious – though I preferred my partner's chicken curry to my beef, but she felt that mine was delicious too. we liked the fried tofu rings that had a bit of fish paste, seems like a unique food item. would give 5 stars if not for so much food on the menu being sold out 1.5 hrs before closing time. I found the price very reasonable – it is the CBD, the portion is generous and you can't compare this quality of curry rice with standard hawker food. not sure what people are demanding sometimes."
Supercurry,"Just look at this decadent plate of artwork. This is sinfully delicious stuff! I only hope their fried chicken is consistent because when done right, it’s tender, moist and crispy shiok. For $7.80 the serving is just overloaded for me. Veggie, more crisps and all. I would have liked some braised pork and sunny side up, but it’s already too much. I had to half the rice. Remember to whack some of that tangy orange chilli sauce on the side. Damn shiok.  Back again. Omg the crispy fried chicken so damn shiok."
Lim Bo Fruit Rojak,"One of the best rojaks I’ve eaten! Sauce is thick and acidity is just nice. Although it might be a little salty, the sourness of the mango and pineapple balances everything out. I’m a repeat customer, love this place… must try the prawn fritters!"
Lim Bo Fruit Rojak,Dunno why it took me too long to come here! Mr Leong did a good job preserving the authenticity of the paste - his little tweaks of the condiments are acceptable IMO.  This is a very good rendition of Penang Fruit Rojak and not to be mistaken for local versions.  It’s a horrible apple to orange comparison if you do :-( Just like comparing Singapore Laksa with Sarawak Laksa ….  Like Denise Tan advice - leave your expectations at the door ;-)
Lim Bo Fruit Rojak,"This is my mom's favourite rojak. When the owner/staff found out, he specially arranged to have my order delivered (reasonable rate) as I didn't have time to go down to the stall. I'm so touched and thankful! I ordered two Lim Bo Specials, as that is what my mom used to order. The portion was more than enough for our usual Sunday dinner with the whole family of 12 pax :red_heart: Everything was properly packed separately: the fruits & cucumber slices, the rojak sauces, the chilli, the you tiao, prawn fritters and fish skin. Needless to say, my entire family enjoyed it very much :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes: my only regret is that I forgot to take a pic :grinning_face_with_sweat: so I attach a pic of their menu here :victory_hand:"
Lim Bo Fruit Rojak,"Here at this new Hawker Centre for the first time. The layout of the food centre is spacious and airy. Waited in the queue and ordered the $8 portion with fried prawn fritters. The ingredients are fresh and cut into nice bite size pieces. The premium stuffs like the apples and mangoes are pretty few on the plate. The Rojak sauce is fragrant and thick, generously dressed coating the plate. The prawn fritter is a surprise which I have not seen in other stalls. It is well prepared and not oily. I do not enjoy as much as others having the prawn fritter with my Rojak and will probably skip in my next visit."
Lim Bo Fruit Rojak,"Nicely positioned in the middle of the hawker centre, hard to miss this funky named stall!  The rojak sauce is super shiok! Love the taste and mix of this rojak, makes it stand out from the regular rojak you eat across Singapore.  Interesting thing to note: you can identify the owner by the cute dinosaurs tattoo on his arm!"
Lai Lai Taiwan Casual Dining,"Always love to come by for their set lunch promotion.  1. Value for money - it comes with a cup of red milk tea. You can request for no sugar or less sugar. 2. Delicious 3. Good 4. Generous portion  A few items we exceptionally love: 三杯鸡，卤肉饭，curry chicken rice, popcorn chicken, fried oyster mushroom!  Love the gravy in the 三杯鸡! But I think the stew beef alittle tough.  But I think the service of the cashier can be improved. We couldn’t really hear her when she said no pay-wave. And gave us the nonchalant expression. Didn’t enjoy that kind of treatment. But that aside, definitely a great place for meals!"
Lai Lai Taiwan Casual Dining,"A place with good Taiwanese food at reasonable pricing.  Particularly liked the sampler meal with a small portion of big intestine mee sua and braised pork rice, so you can try two of the best dishes altogether.  The skewers are a little tough for my liking.  The pancake dish is served in a generous portion and recommended for pork floss lovers."
Lai Lai Taiwan Casual Dining,"Ate here for quick dinner with kids, decent food and affordable price. We’re not big eater so the portion is nice for us. Taste wise is okay, comfort food and we finished it!"
Lai Lai Taiwan Casual Dining,"The Taiwanese restaurant serves famous Taiwanese beef noodle, the set lunch is good with the bubble tea, not cheap but it’s something not easy to find in Singapore."
Lai Lai Taiwan Casual Dining,"Great service. Surprised how staff can remember all our orders. Portions are big, even for kids meals. Liked the beef noodles. Dumplings was decent but won't blow you away."
BlackGoat,"Went on Sunday and crowd started even before 530pm. Feels competitive as a customer. Not sure if weekday will be better.  Food serving time is adequate as the food needs to be grill/rest/fried. Food is served to your table. Feels better if there's a buzzer or number system so it will be a self collect system.  Was actually looking forward to their grilled crab but not available on the day.  Steak is good for the price paid, $19, with salt flakes. Comes with fries and salad.  Chicken burger is tender but the sauce is overwhelming. Feels a little gelat after eating.  Brownies with ice cream is great! Not too sweet yet rich in flavor.  Overall, if you have the time and want to adventure new dining place, why not try this out?"
BlackGoat,Operated by youngsters. Queue was pretty long and some dishes were no longer available when it is our turn to make order. One of the steak was over cooked but staff offered a complimentary one apologetically. We did not even make a complain or feedback. Thumbs up!
BlackGoat,"Everything was cooked to perfection. The chicken was so juicy! The sauce on the huge chicken was heavenly! I have no idea what it’s made of, but it’s amazing.  The steak was extremely tender. The korean sauce and the other sauces combined really well. I don’t know how to put it in words. I can only say it’s perfect.  Overall the experience was amazing. Stationed in a hawker, yet with some spectacular service. I really love how the chef approached me to ask for my feedback. Really shows how much love and effort he put into cooking the dishes, always looking for ways to improve.  Would definitely go back again. Very worth it, I highly recommend everyone to bring their friends and family to try this hidden gem."
BlackGoat,"A fresh take on local hawker food, serving restaurant type steak at a rather reasonable price.  The steak is properly cooked and the brownies were amazing but a little too big for two to share.  Just be aware that the queue is crazy and the shop only takes orders exactly at 1730 when it is open. If you cannot wait, this is definitely not the place for you.  For those who would like to try a 19 dollar ribeye steak at a hawker centre, do support this local business :)  included the video of the queue situation just before it opens.  *Nice to have fellow patrons that didn't charged like barbarian but instead arranged themselves based on their time of arrival :)"
BlackGoat,"Ordered 1. Fried chicken burger Patty was large which was a definite plus. However, the overall experience fell a bit short due to my personal preference for the sauce  2. Lamb Slightly gamy taste to it, which may not be to everyone's liking. Maybe better without the sauce.  3. Steak The steak was cooked to my preferred medium rare and had a decent char flavor. Best amongst the 3 dishes I’ve ordered  Total cost: $49  Positive side, the uncle who took the order provided a pleasant experience :)"
Pha Muk,"Crab Laksa is good with strong infusion of kaffir leaves :leaf_fluttering_in_wind:and came with super chicken feet. I prefer the YTF to be less sweet and we think that’s possible with request of lesser red sweet sauce which is added to the broth, or just request for it to be separated. The fried wonton skin which came with the YTF was crisp and we ordered another $2 of it :thumbs_up_light_skin_tone: lady chef speaks mandarin and is very friendly ."
Pha Muk,I love the Crab meat laksa. It was spicy and tasty. The fermented port salad is also recommended. Limited seating but it was not very crowded. The food are taste like homecooked meal.
Pha Muk,This place used to be at Golden Mile at the supermarket. Tried the noodles. Crab Laksa and Yong Tau Foo. $7 a hit. Worth a try.
Pha Muk,"Tried their Thai Yong Dao Fu, taste good but not all ingredients are known to me. Might try other menu on next visit"
Pha Muk,"The pork noodle soup is soooo good. And the hand made meat ball is so soft and juicy, despite its appearances. And has the best papaya salad I’ve had outside of Thailand."
Rempapa,The food here is great! Extremely flavourful and each bite is a pleasant mix of spices. Would definitely recommend the beef cheek rendang! So tender it melts in your mouth! Atmosphere is great as well.
Rempapa,"This was my second time eating at Rempapa.  My favourite dishes this round were the stir fried chee cheong fun and the chickpea curry with string hoppers. Chef, these two dishes are keepers on the menu, please don’t take them out.  We also ordered their kueh kosui and their daily assortment of kuehs. Lovely textures and a must order if you visit!"
Rempapa,"1st time dining in Rempapa and was attracted by the 1st bite of their Fried Chee Cheong Fun with strong fragrance of fish sauce and pork lard (both of which we like & use often in our cookings, esp with Redboat fish sauce). The richness of coconut flavour in the Nasi Lemak and Indian spices and salt in the fried chicken also caught my attention but both doesn't goes well together, definitely not with the lame chilli. Felt jelak by the extraordinary heavy flavours of both dishes and oily lips to throat.... most probably will be our last visit even though we didn't follow the recommended Fried Chee Cheong Fun to go with Ayam Lemak Chilli Padi & Babi Tulang Masak Assam by the Chinese male service staff!!! Just can't imagine how the dishes can be matched:thinking_face:"
Rempapa,"Nice dining environment. Price is at higher end. Service charges included, and the crew are friendly & attentive.  Food is kind of disappointing due to the saltiness. - Babi pongteh’s meat texture is tender & good, however sauce is slightly salty (still palatable when eaten with rice) - Ayam Buah Keluak’s is extremely salty (with a detectable bitter end note), even when eaten with rice. - Sambal sweet potato leaf is the saviour of the night, well balanced flavours.  Revisit? Probably have to think twice."
Rempapa,Extremely impressed with the food quality and taste.  I shall not doubt the authenticity as the varieties we ordered has left me and my family impressed and happy.  I will return to try other dishes.  Do note the pricing can be a little high but I guess it was well worth it.
Keong Saik Bakery,pastries are nicely made and the new space provides more seating although its still limited. do look for a seat to chope before ordering for dine in if its crowded but they were nice to look for one for me as i was alone. drinks were so so and miss-able but the pastries were generally great. the popular ones get sold out quite early on a sunday by lunch time. definitely worth a visit.
Keong Saik Bakery,"Cute place - loved how the interior featured a blend of material (wood, stone, concrete, steel) I do enjoy the Seashore cake but I know my friend who works at KSB says a lot of customers don’t finish it - do try it if you enjoy Earl grey flavours! The lemon pistachio eclair was interesting. Not too sure what we felt about the lemon and pistachio pairing though - it’s less typical than pairings like pistachio and strawberry / raspberry. Teh o kosong beng was a little meh - should’ve tried the lychee tea thing that everyone else was getting."
Keong Saik Bakery,A nice relaxing cafe at city fringe. Spacious and modern design. Not many seats if you come on crowded weekends. Price reasonable given the quality for their bakery and drinks
Keong Saik Bakery,"First time coming to Keong Saik Bakery after seeing and hearing so much about it after it got particularly famous during Covid for their burnt cheesecake. The cakes are not cheap, but thankfully they were on burpple and I could enjoy 2 cakes for the price of 1. As such, I enjoyed both cakes for a grand total of $9.20.  I ordered the burnt cheesecake along with one of their higher priced cake called taromisu, pretty much a tiramisu but using yam to flavor the mascarpone layer. The yam flavor itself wasn’t strong but definitely could taste a hint of that flavor. Overall, a v good slice of tiramisu both in terms of taste and aesthetic. Needless to say, cheesecake was great as it is known for that.  I had both as a takeaway and had them almost 2hrs later which I found to be ideal as both had sort of ‘melted’ a little, making it softer and ideal for consumption.  Edit: finally visited the new outlet which is within an office industrial building. The space is much larger and charming but the seating area is still very limited. Made use of my burpple promo and got some cakes 1-1. Quality is fantastic as always, this time going for the matcha cake and blueberry tart. I also tried one of their new creations which was a mentaiko pastry within a cube croissant. As the space was limited, we had to make do and use a stool as a table as my family of 4 gathered around to devour each piece."
Keong Saik Bakery,The croissant tastes very good! Coffee is too strong for me… Dinning time is 1 hour. Short queue on Sunday afternoon. Not too difficult to get seats.
Fantastic Dim Sum,"Wanted to try this dim sum place for some interesting siew mais so decided to visit the place. Was having quite a bit of people but still easy to get a table on a Saturday lunch. Looked at the menu the variety is not very extensive, not sure but they seem to be working together with the porridge stall next to it the staff were just walking into each others kitchen to help out. It was also so much better as that added to the variety of dishes offered for dim sum. So ended up ordering a bit here and there from both stalls and looked more complete like a dim sum meal. Food was decent but some mixed reviews. The fantastic siew mai was interesting but the meat feels very frozen and processed, not the same when you visit some places where they make the siew mai fresh daily. Beancurd roll in oyster sauce was salty, and the rest was average. Loved the rice noodle roll with doughstick, the you tiao was crispy almost throughout. The shrimp rice roll was okay but the rice roll was too thick for my liking. Porridge was well cooked and the ingredients were fresh. Ok meal, not expensive but was actually expecting better."
Fantastic Dim Sum,"Best yam puff 芋角 that i tasted so far. the yam was fluffy and very well balanced with quite lean and well-marinated charsiew. must try!  we got their sampling platter of siew mai to try. they were creatively interesting, well made but not not wow enough for me to order again. pricey.  菜头粿 was too dense to my liking. preferred shredded carrot within.  Prawn dumpling was normal.  will definitely get their 芋角 if i'm around the vicinity but not worth to travel all the way for just one dimsum that i like."
Fantastic Dim Sum,"Tried the dim sum dishes of Phoenix Craw, Crystal Bun, and Fried Mango Prawn Roll. While the overall experience was decent, it didn't quite reach the level of excellence I was hoping for."
Fantastic Dim Sum,"Got the below dishes:  Black gold lava custard bun 黑金流沙包 [SGD 5.60] - pricey and nothing special... just normal 流沙包 tbh, a bit small but filling was nice and flowy  Crystal shrimp dumpling 晶莹鲜虾饺 [SGD 4.50] - this was good! Skin texture was soft and slightly chewy + prawns were big, plump & juicy!  Black sesame pudding 黑芝麻布丁 [SGD 3.20] - actually came for this so I was excited!!!! On the first bite I thought it was too sweet to be a trublu bssm dessert :woozy_face: But the richness & nuttiness really shone through on subsequent bites! Ended up enjoying this a lot after getting used to the sweetness level!  There's another matcha pudding as well, probs I'll go back for that! :grinning_squinting_face:"
Fantastic Dim Sum,"Went by for lunch at ARC 380. Had some really good dimsum and youtiao chee cheong fun. The food court was cosy and clean, and I felt really comfortable dining there. Highly recommended!"
Kok Sen Restaurant,"Pretty good. The noodles are amazing. They don't look exactly like ""model food"" but the taste is great. Massive prawns, springy noodles. The food definitely live up to its Michelin recommendations. Service is quite cold."
Kok Sen Restaurant,"This is my first time after they move to a new and comfortable dining space (same street in Keong Saik Rd). Seats a bit cramped but with better ambience. We had to share our table with other diners. We are here for their renowned Big Prawn Horfun. Somehow I felt that it was a bit different but it’s still good. At Kok Sen, every bite is a celebration of culinary excellence."
Kok Sen Restaurant,"We love Tze Char places, had to queue 40 mins after we arrived around 530pm (Sat) Been here once at their previous location further up the road. As usual, we ordered dishes we love, hor fun, chilli kangkong, bitter gourd w/sliced fish, Ngoh Hiang, yong tau foo, beef w/spring onions, roasted chicken + one big bottle Heineken Voila only $150, for 5 of us, can’t be happier. Highly recommended for those who love tze char dishes anywhere anytime"
Kok Sen Restaurant,The hor fun was good with some wok hei and good savoury sauce but the rest of the items we ordered was just normal decent zi char food.  Service were thoughtful and I’m impressed. We insisted on ordering every item large size as we had 6 hungry pax but the staff just ignore us and key in medium size for most items knowing that we can’t finish all of it. And he was spot on!! We had to takeaway some of it at the end!! :folded_hands:  I will love eat the hor fun again if there is not much queue!
Kok Sen Restaurant,"One of the best zi char restaurants in Singapore, there's a good menu offering a great variety of dishes so be sure to come in a group to try more dishes.  Everything we ordered was packed of flavour.  The slightly chewy texture of the perfectly cooked Yong Tau Foo, the big prawn noodle in the rich and comforting sauce, the nuggets of flavour that were the fried crispy roast pork.  You should BYO tissues or napkins."
Burnt Cones,"Tasty ice cream flavours and crispy waffles! We ordered and enjoyed the banoffee and black forest waffle sets for sharing. -1 star because one of the ice creams weren't scooped properly, with a hole in the middle, as you can see from the first picture. Hope the staff gets better training about ice cream scooping! Would still recommend!"
Burnt Cones,"The ice cream has a really smooth texture and the different flavours goes well together. The waffle had a nice crisp and did not become too soggy even though the ice cream was on it for a good amount of time. The cones were also a perfect size to fit 2 generous scoops of ice cream, perfect on the go! The ambiance at sunset way is a plus since it’s really nice for a good catch up with friends or meetups."
Burnt Cones,"Not the best ice cream in town, but giving it a better review as there is chocolate mint flavor (cos I love mint and it’s hard to find). The milk ice creams are milky and, the cones taste burnt.. overall great handout place with ample parking and other food outlets."
Burnt Cones,"Very nicely baked waffle, the burnt outer and soft inner parts. Complements very well with honey and the milk cookies ice-cream which I picked. I've always like their milky flavours but this is the first time I've had their waffle and my cravings were satisfied! Very chill place to visit anytime!"
Burnt Cones,"Came on a Wednesday night, indoors was packed but outdoors had some seating. When we found a table indoors, the staff cleared the utensils etc but didn’t wipe the table even though there were blots of melted ice cream.  Ordered the pistachio cone ($8) and yam cup ($5), the pistachio is very thick but more on the savoury side (reminds me of nut butter). Yam on the other hand was a tad too sweet. The cone was normal too, so I don’t quite understand how this place is so highly rated :thinking_face:"
Burnt Cones,"At 3pm on a weekday, the Newest mall is quite dead except for this place.  Very basic tables and stools.  Not much ambience and definitely no views as it's located inside the mall.  Blackforest Waffle was really good - chocolate Waffle with 2 scoops of ice cream. The dark chocolate ice cream was really good.  Still could not figure out if $23 was justifiable versus ordering the $7 Waffle with ice cream toppings.  Portion was good.  Friendly staff."
Burnt Cones,"I recently visited Burnt Cones, and I must say, it was a delightful experience! The staff was incredibly sweet and friendly. The ice cream itself was truly delicious. We tried a variety of flavors including Pistachio, Milk & Chocolate, Thai Coconut Lychee, Strawberry, Speculoos, and Milk. As a self-proclaimed Pistachio gelato enthusiast, I was particularly impressed with their rendition. It was creamy, smooth, and dense, bursting with authentic pistachio flavor. All thumbs up for Burnt Cones! The overall tone of the place is light and friendly, creating a fantastic atmosphere for enjoying these tasty treats."
Burnt Cones,"we used to frequent Up In Smoke alot. it is our to go place for the philly cheesesteak and waffles & ice cream. havent been here for almost a year now. the shop changed its name to burnt cones and extremely disappointed that they no longer have the cheesesteak! its one of the best we’ve ever had!! so sad..  the standard of waffle has dropped. their waffles used to be my favourite waffles ever! but this time the waffle was almost burnt.. u can see from the pictures that even inside the waffle is brown as though its chocolate flavoured waffle but its not.  tried the oven fried chicken & waffle. chicken was juicy, waffle was less burnt thankfully. would have preferred more butter and more honey/syrup. the whole dish was quite bland and dry, only taste from the chicken. there were drizzles of honey/syrup but not enough for taste.  the service was slow as there was only one man running the shop on a weekday morning. there was only us and another customer.  i really hope they can bring back the cheesesteak.. else, i probably wont be back. there’s lots of other good food at newest."
Burnt Cones,"They have really nice waffles and ice creams. Flavours of choice for me: purple yam, black sesame, choc mint. If getting a waffle, I'd suggest asking them to not drizzle the honey... too much sweet can be a bad thing lol. If no one seems to be there, ring the bell, we waited for a while before I noticed the bell on the counter.  Highly recommended for a dessert/sugar fix!"
Burnt Cones,Chanced upon this outlet. Decided to try their coffee. They are using Colombia beans. Love the aroma and coffee taste is good. Smooth and not too harsh. Decided to pop by in again after work to try their ice cream. Had the thai coconut lychee flavour. Creamy and not too rich with light hints of lychee.
Burnt Cones,"Terrible experience! Paid $15.12 for 2 tiny scoops of ice cream that were way too sweet and was already melting when it was passed to us.  No tasting of ice cream, no waffles available despite stating that last order for waffles was at 9.30pm for this outlet, no mention of GST until you’re at the cashier.  Sitting area was for a bar and you have to order a drink + pay 10% service charge if you would like to sit down to have your ice cream.  Prices and serving sizes are different from the original outlet at clementi, this place feels like a total scam."
Burnt Cones,"Tried their Uji Matcha, Maple Walnut and 85% Dark Chocolate, overall is too sweet and is not our liking. The dark chocolate is rich in flavour and slightly bitter.  Wanted to sit in and enjoy their waffle ice-cream. But, we were told that seats were only available for order drinks. It was a Friday night and there was a live band show. LOL"
Burnt Cones,Didnt know there is an ice cream place nearby an office area! It is quite hidden. You have to walk in the sail to be able find this gem! A good ice cream treat after walking iLight.
Burnt Cones,"Out of the many waffles I've tried in Singapore, this waffle beats all of them by a mile. There is something unique about all their waffles - an enduring crispiness which would last even after all the ice cream has melted. The waffles appear to be caramelised on both sides and carry a subtle sweetness with every bite, even without the maple syrup. Not to mention how fluffy and light the interior of the waffle is too.  However, it is the priciest, and for good reason. If you dine in here, there is service charge + GST on top of your total bill. A takeaway plain waffle cost me $9 already. Yet the waffle itself is definitely worth the price.  I can't say the same for the ice cream, however. Considering the sweetness of the plain waffle even without syrup, I was looking for a balancing flavour. Mango Passionfruit and strawberry basil were the options which weren't rich or sweet. The mango Passionfruit  was way too sour and the strawberry basil was average at best.  I also tried honeycomb, pistachio, lychee coconut amongst others and they were either too sweet or lacking in flavour overall (at least when paired with the waffles).  Nevertheless, this place remains as my personal favourite waffle place (together with the other branches of burnt cones) and still deserved a 5 stars for their outstanding waffles."
Burnt Cones,Not a bad place to chill and have some dinner and drinks. The place is quite quiet and hidden under some high-end residential building.  I really do like the waffles. Very unlike the others I’ve had at most ice cream parlour. Crispy and fragrant. The ice cream ube is unique and not commonly found. Not so much a fan of the pistachio-flavoured ice cream though. There is this sweet syrup drizzled over it.  Price is on the higher side. It was close to $24 with service charge for a plate of waffles and 2 scoops of ice cream. So minus a star for price factor.
Burnt Cones,"Love the space. Great coffee, gelato, and the Buttermilk waffles are out of this world. Affordable prices and friendly staff team."
Burnt Cones,Had the Ube gelato with their cone and it was delicious! Would be better if you could have a QR code to scan for the menu instead having to flip through a slightly stained booklet at the cashier.
Burnt Cones,Great gelato and even better waffles. Honestly one of the best waffles in Singapore! Love how fluffy it is on the inside but with suuuper crispy exterior! Biscoff gelato is my fav followed by pistachio!
Burnt Cones,

BANNGKOK Street Food,"The place is certainly overhyped for its decor/vibes as it gives off “authentic” Bangkok street food aesthetic. The marketing team certainly did a great job promoting their launch as the ambience of the restaurant is the main takeaway there. So yay social media team! The menu also looks very appealing to look at, so once again, props to the creative team.  But food wise, it’s a no. Kangkong was a bit too salty. Drinks too sweet but I guess that’s just how Thai drinks are.  Had their clear Tom yum, decent ah nothing too good or outstanding. The harimau menangis was the best dish I had."
BANNGKOK Street Food,"As authentic as it gets. Think street food eating place, not as comfy as we wanted it to be but the food, just sublime! Tried soooo many tomyam in sg and ive to say this is my favourite and nearest to the original one in thailand, the flavours are amazing and all well seasoned. Found comfort in their mama noodle with a side of chicken skin, totally awesome! Overall a happy camper to be dining here."
BANNGKOK Street Food,"Ordered a tom yam fried rice but it was bland; not reminiscent of tom yam flavour at all. Service was really slow. Waited almost an hour for my food and could see that they were behind on other customers’ orders as well. On top of that, their online ordering system was confusing as there was an option to select “white rice” in the set which made us think that it came with a separate serving of white rice but it didn’t. The set consisted of the fried rice, the sides placed on it and a drink which amounted to $18.90 in total (before any taxes) which is overpriced in my opinion. The tomyum soup itself did not have much contents, just alot of soup."
BANNGKOK Street Food,"Came here from friend's recommendation. The food is just SOOO GOOD. Very fast service, friendly and helpful people, convenient seatings.  The place is right on the road corner (the google pin seemed to be off a few meter) Very recommended to visit!"
BANNGKOK Street Food,Nice halal Thai food in the heart of Bugis. Their tom yum and kaya bread is amazing. Also love their Thai milk tea slushies! Other meat side dishes can be a little salty. Would come back here just for the yummy tom yum!!
Heng Kee Curry Chicken,"Came on a public holiday to try and a queue was already forming before the stall opened. It took a while to get to my turn even though I was 6th in the queue because people in front of me were buying around 10 bowls each.  Really liked the curry here, it's not diluted at all. Even though the chicken was cooked separately from the curry, you could still taste it taking on some of the curry flavour.  My preference is definitely this stall over their competition on the second level."
Heng Kee Curry Chicken,"Very good bowl of curry chicken noodles at Hong Lim Complex. The curry texture and taste somehow just on point. Since it's always long queue, I would usually go for the L bowl where all ingredients like tender juicy chicken, tao pok, bean sprouts and fish cakes shall fulfil my fullest satisfaction. There's no other branches, this is one and only."
Heng Kee Curry Chicken,"Had a wonderful lunch at Heng Kee Curry Chicken Noodle. I love curry mee and this one is probably the best in Singapore. The chicken is tender and juicy and the curry is the spicy and fragrant. I also like the longish fish cake, somehow it gives more satisfaction than just eating it in smaller cuts.  And not forgetting the chilli, it was spicy and bursting with umami. Tried many curry noddles from different stalls, but this one is definitely the winner."
Heng Kee Curry Chicken,Standard has dropped and the gravy is too watery as compared to years ago.  $9 for this bowl of curry chicken noodles with breast meat.  Doubt i will go back again
Heng Kee Curry Chicken,For me it was a five star dish and a deserved Michelin star. The soup had a lot of flavour. The noodles were good. The amount of add ones were generous. I had a small portion and I was satisfied with that. An old woman was doing the payment and I had nice chat with her too.
Heng Kee Curry Chicken,"This stall is introduced by Mark Wiens and for those who haven't try it yet, please give it a go. I've had such a pleasant experience here.  • The sauce is flavourful, the different selections of meat and vegetables are such a good combination in terms of texture and taste. (I asked the uncle to pick all the meat and veggies according to his recommendation)  • The uncle is super duper nice, friendly and just so heart-warming. You can tell he is doing his work with joy. He's very skilled and works at a crazy pace.  Experience it yourself and enjoy!"
Heng Kee Curry Chicken,"It is a one man show here as the friendly uncle cook and serve all by himself. I ordered a plate of rice with curry chicken drumstick, braised pork and cabbage for a mere $5.  The large curry chicken drumstick is tender and fragrant with the spices of curry. Uncle even went as far as deboning it for me so it would be easier to eat. The spiciness of the curry sauce was mild with a hint of coconut milk.  As for the braised pork, uncle asked if I wanted it fatty or lean to which I requested for 半肥瘦.  This curry rice is certainly value for money because uncle actually chopped the entire slab of braised pork into slices and placed them all onto my plate. The lean parts are not tough while the fatty parts are melt-in-the-mouth tender."
Heng Kee Curry Chicken,Friendly uncle. Food is savory not too overwhelming. Quene moves along fast but usually sold out at 1pm. Overall a delightful experience dining
Heng Kee Curry Chicken,"Visited on a lunch time at 12.30pm and there was quite a wide variety of foods to choose. I feel like trying all of them actually!! Haha. Anyway I ordered the fried egg omelette because it looks so thick. I also picked the minced meat ball but sorry to say that I don’t like the taste... And lastly the pork chop, which is a must-order when you come here. The fried pork chop had crunchy skin and the meat was pretty thick and tender. I will be back for sure! Next time want to try the braised meat!! Looks so yum too!!!"
Heng Kee Curry Chicken,"Amazing value, hearty, good tasting Hainan city rice. Had own loyal following of fans. Arrive late to risk seeing items being sold out. Cabbage can do with a little longer stewing to get it all translucent and mash-like.  Enjoyable, though a tad sweet."
Heng Kee Curry Chicken,"Ignore the stated opening hours. Stall opened wholely depends on owner's mood these days.  Nice light curry. Addition of fried dried shrimp chilli oil more for flavour rather than heat or aroma. Perfectly flavoursome poached chicken. Neither overcooked nor dried out. Enjoyable.  Same size bowl for all $5,6,8 portions. $8 gets only 4 chuncks of chopped chicken. Pricey by comparison to other hawkers peddling the same food item."
Heng Kee Curry Chicken,"Absolutely love this stall. Their curry itself is amazing and the person serving it takes great care with what is added per bowl including asking if you want oil off the top. They let you pick your chicken (thigh, breast, wing) based on what they have left as well as three options for portions based on price points and three noodle options. The chili paste is delicious and a great addition for some extra spice to the base curry. The portions are hefty and the bean curd alone is already good, chicken aside. As an added bonus the owners are extremely kind and helpful. Both the woman taking your order and the man building it made sure you got what you wanted and were also just nice to interact with."
Heng Kee Curry Chicken,"The following 2 Points are very important and what I love about this stall. Uncle is very polite! And we can choose the type of meat we want (dark meat or white meat).  We for the curry soup, it’s abit watery compare to the rest of curry noodles standard in Singapore but that does not mean it’s not good."
Heng Kee Curry Chicken,"Very polite & well mannered stall owners. Quite surprised when auntie asked if I wanted which part of chicken, skin, oil? Ordered a thigh and all in. Noodles cooked just right. Chicken is very tender, nicely boiled. Curry is light but very well flavoured. Taste like lightened laksa version. The chillis is not too spicy. $6 for the bowl is definitely affordable."
Heng Kee Curry Chicken,"A popular choice at Berseh Food Center. You have three different selections of chicken parts to go with your noodle, breast, wing or drumstick. The noodles also come with fishcake slices and friend Toa Pok. The curry is flavourful and light."
Butahage,"Go for the Obihiro Japanese Pork Loin Don, although much more expensive than the Canadian pork loin as the quality of the meat is so much better, tender and flavourful. I rate the Japanese pork 5 stars and the Canadian pork only 3 stars. The regular size bowl has 5 large slices of pork while the large has 6 slices. I also enjoyed the tempura udon. The tempura batter was light and crispy. The udon was too soft for me but it was still good. Service was good, the staff were friendly and helpful and listened to feedback. I requested to sit at the table first. The shop just opened and they were trying to stagger sitting down the guest as they did not want to jam up the kitchen."
Osteria Mozza,"Celebrated my birthday with spouse. Excellent service. Classy and cozy dining experience. Delicious food. Come with open mind. Strong and unique taste. Range of wine, cocktail and mock tails. Coconut ice-cream scoop and birthday wishes."
Osteria Mozza,"We were here for a birthday celebration dinner. There were 10 of us, and we managed to get tables because we made reservations.  I forgot the names of the menu items, so I'll try to describe them.  The food was really amazing. I'd say one of the main stars would be the cheese. The starters with the burrata cheese were brilliant. They were very smooth and soft. There's one served with kale and it was superb.  You absolutely must try the square pasta with egg and cheese inside of it. Imagine a single large piece of ravioli pasta, and the stuffing is egg and delicious cheese.  The staff gets full marks. Our waiter was very patient and kindly explained and recommended what to order. Our birthday girl was surprised when she received a card from the restaurant staff wishing her Happy Birthday.  It was expensive, but the food and experience were very worth it.  Cashless payment accepted. Hotel parking available if you drive."
Osteria Mozza,"Exceptional service by the one and only Hermes - this genuinely adds to the already wonderful dining experience at Osteria Mozza. You will have no regrets going with any of his recommendations on the menu :) We also appreciate the professional and remarkable service by Jason.  Food-wise we will let the pictures do the talking; one needed mention would be the Burrata Apricot which was an amazingly balanced and textured dish.  The ambience is fantastic, and the team and floor managers/staff really take pride in what they do. Bravo!"
Osteria Mozza,"Located in Hilton Orchard. Really kind and attentive staff made me enjoy dinner a lot. The salad was quite yummy and fresh. However the pasta was under expectation. The highlight was ice cream. The portion was quite big enough for two. I took Mango ice cream. It was really tasty. If you are a member of Hilton, you can get a discount. The discount rate surely differs from your membership level. For Diamond, 25% discount will be given.  I like the pizza here but unfortunately the pizza isn’t available in dinner."
Osteria Mozza,"The food was very good. Love the creativity of the dishes. Not your typical pasta or Italian dishes. Service was however, not meet expectation. Maybe that are under staffed as we need to wave quite awhile to catch their attention."
Eat 3 Bowls,"The food and drink are quite decent, taste good. Not much choices on the menu, don have any snacks too. But the portions are quite small for the price.  Will come here if pass by this area but not worth it if come here purposely."
Eat 3 Bowls,Had an awesome time trying the 3 mini-bowls set that included one bubble tea. Whether authentic Taiwanese taste doesn’t matter as the food tasted great! Worth trying.
Eat 3 Bowls,"Whole place mimics a Taiwan classroom set up. Very nice with the Taiwan songs playing in the background. Food is reasonably priced and good. Not crowded, a hidden gem."
Eat 3 Bowls,It has this Taiwan authentic taste. Recommended if you miss the 卤肉饭. The staff was kind to add taro balls into my winter melon drink - refreshing. Worth a visit.
Eat 3 Bowls,"Went on a weekday around 2 pm and there was ample seating. Lovely staff who were welcoming and friendly.  Heard a lot about this Taiwanese diner and finally got around to visiting when I was in the area.  Ordered the sampler set of 3, a portion of large intestines, silken tofu with century egg and brown sugar milk with pearls via my phone and settled the bill at the cashier.  While dishes we ordered were tasty, the food was served lukewarm-room temperature and not piping hot, which greatly lessened my overall enjoyment factor.  All rice bowls were quite small (even for regular sized items not in the sampler). Proportion-wise, there was a higher rice to meat gravy ratio.  I enjoyed the Lu rou fan and chicken rice over the mee sua. The intestines were nicely flavored and silken tofu with floss and century egg was no frills and refreshing. Bubble tea portions were generous and pearls were Q."
Eat 3 Bowls,The foods here are really nice and yummy. Love the braised pork rice the most. The Taiwanese sausages is also nice comes with raw garlic. The fried chickens just okay but not too bad. The garlic soya sauce sliced pork also really yummy. Perfect with a bowl of white rice. Hehe. Highly recommended.
Eat 3 Bowls,"My favourite place for Taiwanese lu rou fan, it's the best in SG. Do order the onsen eggs as well, perfectly done with marinated and soft yolk. The Mee Sua is not bad too but the vegetable dish is overcooked and too soft for me. Best of all, prices are very reasonable. Take note that portions are small hence the name for big eaters. It's a small restaurant so go early to avoid queues. Service is fast though. It is the only restaurant I know where you not only order using your phone but pay also."
Eat 3 Bowls,Authentic Taiwanese comfort food old days taste. Helpful staff. Can pay with credit card if you scan QR code on table. Fast service.
Eat 3 Bowls,"[Visit in May 2023] Felt like I was transported to Taiwan in this cosy eatery. The Taiwanese food here was enjoyable, service was fast even during lunch peak period.  It’s one of the few comfortable aircon eateries along this road that is reasonably-priced.  Will be back to try the other dishes :thumbs_up:"
Eat 3 Bowls,"One of the best Taiwanese food I’ve eaten in SG and I’m returning for sure. In fact I’ve heard that This restaurant is the closest you can get to the authentic taste of Taiwan food.  We got the braised pork rice (Lu rou fan) which was so damn good. The pork belly melted so easily and the portion was so so generous.  We got the chicken rice too. It was a simple dish but they managed to make it taste so good and it gave me a homely feeling eating it.  We also got the salted crispy chicken and it was true to its name, crispy. Very crispy, very tender. The chicken was fragrant and the portion was really generous too, good for sharing.  I’d say the must get are the braised pork rice and salted crispy chicken. The chicken rice tases good but heads up, for people who has a stronger taste bud, they’d think it’s blander than the braised pork rice and salted crispy chicken."
Minced Pork Bros,"It’s called minced pork bros but the chef was a nice lady and she was the only one cooking on that day we were there.  Tried the signature minced meat noodles and it was quite a surprise. The noodles on its own were already pretty good. Springy, thicker then usual and was nicely mixed with the sauce. The broth was good too and had quite a bit of ingredients in there including a scallop, fish ball and pork.  Pretty good."
Minced Pork Bros,"Nice tasting broth. Not excessively salty. Noodles were plain, great for those who are not into intense and very salty flavored dishes. Pork was sufficiently tender. Chilli was mild and not  spicy, when mixed with noodles made chilli seem diluted. Tried the signature mee pok dry with a bowl of soup, classic noodles with chilli, and teochew modern pork noodles. Teochew modern pork noodles was the least interesting as they no longer serve with abalone, and the onsen egg was average."
Minced Pork Bros,First time trying this. It is a stall selling minced pork noodles. But they do have some options with more or more expensive ingredients. Like abalone. Which is the dish I had.  The noodles are nicely cooked to how I like them. Not overly soft or hard. The egg is a nice addition. Overall the dish is not too salty. Some stalls seem to add a lot of sauce. But not this stall. The taste is balanced and just right. Also to add. There is a kinda traditional taste to it. A bit of old-school minced pork noodles type.
Minced Pork Bros,"Find this unique Bak Chor Mee (BCM) from @mincedpork.bros 肉脞兄弟 at Old Airport Road Food Centre  We have never came across any local BCM stall that uses ikura as its toppings! Not only it looked more pleasing to the overall presentation, these umami pops added a unique seafood flavour to the well balanced sauce (chilli, vinegar and lard oil). Ooh lalah, it was real yumm!  I am picky with noodles and I must say I loved their customized meepok and had to give it some bonus points that it did not have any strong alkaline taste.  The superior soup that came with it had a huge serving of ingredients! The soup was so flavourful and will make you want to drink up more!  You can add more ingredients if you want! I love Her Giao (fish dumplings) and the ones from @mincedpork.bros were filled with ingredients and much bigger.  We tried both Seafood Minced Pork Noodles and Signature Mee Pok with Superior Soup. Nothing more than $6 unless you have add-ons. The serving was more than the usual BCM you can find out there and definitely value for money!"

The owners are also from the famous @roastparadise just a few stores away. Prices are not more than $6 for standard bowls which is definitely wallet friendly considering premium ingredients such as prawn, Japanese abalone and ramen egg. CDC vouchers are also accepted here.  As shared by Randall (owner), they customized their own meepok after rounds of R&D to get the right alkaline level and width of noodles to give customers the best experience where possible. For takeaways, their noodles will remain springy and not soggy. In addition, their meatball and fish dumplings are prepared daily with premium ingredients to ensure freshness & quality.  Items we tried: :steaming_bowl:Teochew Modern Pork Noodles $6: Packed with ingredients including Japanese abalone, ramen egg, meatball, pork slices, minced pork and fried flounder. :steaming_bowl:Signature Mee Pok dry with Superior Soup $5.50: Came with a bowl of flavourful soup packed with loads of ingredients such as scallop, prawn, meatball, pork slices and minced pork. The generous amount of cabbages added natural sweetness to the soup which I truly enjoyed.  Special mention to their well balanced sauce mix of chilli, lard oil and vinegar which complimented the texture of the noodles (especially meepok) well. It would be more perfect if noodles could be slightly more qq. The add-on fish dumplings were also delicious and flavourful.  Truly enjoyed our food and I look forward to try their Seafood Minced Pork Noodles $6 which is topped with Ikura (yes, you didn't read it wrongly) the next round. :thumbs_up:  Definitely worthy to come try this if you are a BCM lover."
Mister Donut,"There is a wide variety of donuts and most people bought the ponder Ring(maybe spelt wrongly) they cap it at 4 per customer. Do check again when you are at the store. It is a bit chewy though. I bought the plain ones. It tasted very plain but with other flavours topped with it, it is nice. I also bought the Angel French Crueller and it is very sweet. Good for young people but not so for the elderly I feel.  I think the queue will shorten as the months go by but at the moment, because of the write ups by bloggers, it will remain long for now. I was happy to queue up for only 15 mins but the hot sellers always run out first. I might buy again later this year when the queue gets shorter:winking_face_with_tongue:Pictures 5-7 are not from the shop but in Slovenia. The donuts were awesome and if I may say, it was better than Mister Donut.:grinning_face_with_big_eyes:"
Mister Donut,Absolutely mediocre donuts. Nothing like what I tried from Mister Donut stores in Japan. Pon De Ring ones are fine but the chocolate chocolate donut was downright dense and disgusting.
Mister Donut,"Very long queue on the first day which was kind of expected . Took 2 hrs in the end, whether it’s worth really depends on you but I really like the strawberry pon de ring Overall the queue management was ok, split the queue in half with second queue outside near mrt entrance They also gave a free donut folder on the first day Strawberry choco special flavour was sold out tho…."
Mister Donut,"The donut is absolutely soft and delicious, sweet and attractive. I purchased 10 donuts but there's some that aren't available :( I'd greatly recommend the PON DE RING donuts and Strawberry & Chocolate donut. Queue isn't that long and you can get your donut for at least 30 minute waiting time. :smiling_face_with_heart-eyes:"
Mister Donut,"Went to queue on a Saturday at lunch time which took me about 40 mins to get the donuts. Definitely a little dumb to queue so long for donuts.  Flavours-wise, I suppose they have just opened up in Singapore so their flavours are just chocolate, strawberry or original. While there were maybe types to choose from, the started to taste the same after a while.  A plus point is that the donuts are not oily and did not have an obvious grease taste for all their donuts.  I'm not sure if you can get one only but when I reached the counter they asked if I wanted a box of 6 or 10. So while I was only planning to get 4 or 5, I ended up with 6.  Would I get this again? Maybe. Only if there were other flavours and the queue was shorter."
Mister Donut,"Bought various donuts at Velocity. In my opinion, I don't really enjoyed it due to the texture. I felt abit dry and not chewy."
Mister Donut,"I love mister donut! Its finally in Singapore. Definitely getting the pon pon as much as I can. Which is max of 4 for now. Chewy and nice. The rest of the donuts are as usual, donuts. The staffs at this branch is friendly, explaining to me on the set prices and ala carte. My family love the honey glazed. Definitely going back again! One thing I think is a waste is that they mentioned that only 6 donuts can be placed in a box. Although I can fit 8 of them, but they’re a little bit squashed. I guess its because they wanna keep the shape of it."
Mister Donut,Bought 10 with different flavors. Will only come back for the Pon De Pain and if less than 5 people in the Q.
Mister Donut,"Came on Tuesday afternoon 3 pm  Duration of Q: 50 mins  Bought a box of 10 but only allowed to buy 4 mochi donuts aka Pon De Ring (minus 2 stars for this)  I mean they could have just do the statistic and planning  Please make these more since everyone mostly coming for these type only  A bit ridiculous if you have to wait for 50 mins but can only buy 4 pcs of PDR  Verdict:  Pon De Ring donut and other flavours :Strawberry &Choco 5/5 I really like the texture, tho taste a bit sweeter than I thought  French curler 1/5 very soggy don’t bother to try unless you airfry at home first  Coconut Choco 2/5 taste exactly like choco cake  Angel cream and Custard cream 2/5"
Mister Donut,Pon De Ring donuts is super chewy and soft. They have plain without glaze which is good. But sadly only limited to 4 pieces per person. Worth queuing for 20mins.
Niu Dian,"It's worth a try. The soup is not bad, spicy at the beginning, and the beef flavor is stronger when you are almost finished. Chrysanthemum milk tea (25% level sugar) surprisingly nice."
Niu Dian,"Great premium beef noodles at a wide range of price points. I went for the most premium set - the Premium Braised Combination Beef Noodles because I wanted to see what they had to offer.  The meal was very very satisfying, and is served separately as a noodle broth and a bowl of beef in gravy, but you can choose to mix them together (which is what I did).  The depth of flavour in the broth was wonderful, and the various beef cuts were all tender and flavorful, with just the right amount of fat to make it succulent without being greasy. If you like your food spicy like I do, they have 2 different chili pastes available as well as pickled vegetables to zhng it up.  Highly recommend to visit!"
Niu Dian,"My to-go place for beef noodles now ~ love their soup & noodles! Didn’t expect to like e black sesame noodles too. Yet to try other soup items; definitely going back soon again! Loves e side dishes too esp e mushroom. For those who prefer stronger taste, should try e braised one.  Taste 8/10:glowing_star: Price 6/10 :glowing_star: Ambience 6/10:glowing_star: Location 6/10:glowing_star:"
Niu Dian,"Was initally slightly skeptial of trying this beef noodles as I recently came back from Taiwan and had some amazing beef noodles there. However, this shop did not disappoint. I got the premium braised beef noodles and it was completely worth the price tag.  The portion size is generous and instead of the usual thin slices of beef, the beef came in chunks and was super tender and flavourful. The free flow salted vegetable that came as a side goes really well with the noodles and helps to balance out the heaviness of the beef. There is even 3 ways to enjoy the beef noodles and the instructions will be provided in a little slip of paper that comes with the meal.  Was definitely a great meal and this store will be one of my top choices when I crave beef noodles next time."
Niu Dian,"Went with a friend to try out their beef noodle soup. We ordered their premium braised combination beef noodle which was not overly spicy. The soup was light and flavourful and had multiple thick cuts of beef. The beef was exceptionally tasty and super tender. We also ordered their sides to try as well and especially liked the century egg with tofu dish. There are free flow condiments that you can add to your dish, overall a great place for a hearty meal."
Niu Dian,Superior flavor for both dry and soup versions of the noodle! i love the chewy texture of the noodles and how well the beef was being braised! it’s very well braised and infused! the bubble tea store serves excellent brewed tea! would come back again!
Niu Dian,Visited Niu Dian on a Tuesday evening and had a pleasant time at the cozy restaurant. I ordered the Pork noodles and was amazed at how good it is! The portion was generous and they gave us a huge portion of the pork in the dish. The noodles texture was chewy and flavorful. Will visit again!
Niu Dian,"I recently tried Niu Dian's combination specialty bee noodles and spicy pepper combination specialty beef noodles, and I must say, they exceeded my expectations! The flavors were absolutely amazing, with a perfect balance of spices and richness. The noodles were cooked to perfection, and the beef was tender and flavorful. The combination of ingredients in both dishes was truly delightful. The portion sizes were generous, and the prices were reasonable. The service was friendly and prompt. Niu Dian has definitely earned a spot as one of my favorite noodle places. I highly recommend trying their specialty dishes!"
Niu Dian,The food was tasty with lots of beef and delicious broth. Tried both the noodle and the rice bowl. Their spicy really has a kick which I enjoyed very much. The drink green tea sour plum drink with aiyu jelly is really good too.
Niu Dian,"An absolute gem! Had their signature beef rice bowl which was lathered with juicy cuts of meat and egg, I absolutely recommend it! Their century egg and tofu was delicious as well:thumbs_up:"
Beigelhaus++,First time trying this bagel place which is Muslim-owned. Do not have the before pictures but the after picture said it all! Wide range of choices of food and drinks. Heaping portions and delicious. Soft bagel and good combination of flavours. Will definitely come back here again. It’s a MUST TRY.
Beigelhaus++,"cute little bagel shop in the heart of CBD! the space is a little small, but it makes for a cozy nook.  affordably priced, especially when you compare it to other merchants in the space. we got the John Trufporta, Moo Donna, Cocky Balboa and one DIY sandwich. the bagel itself lacked that distinctive “chewiness”, instead it had more of a bread texture. that said, the ingredients were what sealed the deal for me! you can tell that the menu was really well thought out, from the ingredient pairings right down to the names :-)  also like how they have a couple of card games for you to play while waiting for your food to be served. been a while since i last played uno!"
Beigelhaus++,"10/10 goes to the amazing staff and service. Fresh and delicious bagels and also a notable mention is their really good coffee. Dark roasted, chocolatey notes and easy on the stomach - not your usual sour/acidic versions.  The Lox bagel comes highly recommended and they also have different add-ons to spruce it up! They are also a halal establishment so definitely a plus for Muslim friends out there.  Thanks for the amazing experience Diyana and team. Will surely be back!"
Beigelhaus++,"All the bagel tried (lamb, chicken, beef) are good. The idea of hashbrown inside bagel seems not working but it actually works. Adding texture to the bagel softness.  Good , worth to try"
Beigelhaus++,Really enjoyed the food and vibe at the cafe. The menu items had really punny names. The bagel cut into two huge portion of sandwiches. You would be able to exchange half of the bagel with your friend or partner. Would eat there again to try the other menu items.
Indulge,"The food is delicious. Done correctly with no burnt out.  Tender.  Have tried the salmon and chicken. The servings are generous and appetising. Place is neat, tidy and clean.  Service is prompt and good."
Indulge,"Update: Very quick service recovery, which is much appreciated. Chalking it up to a one off undercooked chicken. As such, I will still support the outlet/brand. --------- I've always rated this as 5 stars and order regularly through delivery. Today I received raw chicken for both bowls of Chicken cutlet."
Indulge,Have ordered from them few times before from grabfood. Recently pass by the store and decided to have lunch here.  No complains I love the food! Pretty affordable and food was quick. Plating not the best but food is good with generous serving amount.  Tried the Hae bee hiam sauce with prawn pasta. Super tasty and packs with spicy umami flavour. They are pretty generous prawns serving as well!  The chicken chop is pretty good too! The mushroom sauce is so good and accompanied with well-seasoned crispy fries and side of garden salad with sesame sauce.  Will come back again if around the area! :thumbs_up::thumbs_up:
Indulge,"I used to love this place, but the quality declined recently. This time I ordered 2 pasta, 1 bowl had a very small portion, almost half of the usual. The other pasta with normal portion (in the photo) had chicken breast as tough as a rubber. Please fix the inconsistencies."
Indulge,Look rather cosy but the counter staff seriously overcharged me. How can 3 chicken chops cost $34 during lunch time? Then the food is way to sweet. They put way too much teriyaki sauce and mayo until it is awful.
Indulge,"Over all good western food. Fried chicken thigh is a must try.  Coleslaw dislikers tip: you can order your main and instead of coleslaw, just ask for all fries. You get a double portion of fries. Then add the peppers and salt they provide at the counter for seasoned fries."
Indulge,"Had this before when it was at Thomson Road and thought it was quite fine. Today, we ventured to the Yishun outlet and I ordered the truffle mushroom with salad bowl. It should be renamed Garlic Mushroom Bowl really.  I love spicy food and I enjoy garlic. But the amount of garlic was just too much that it completely spoiled the taste of the mushroom and the entire bowl. Perhaps it was to mask the little truffle taste. But whatever it was, it was certainly done overboard.  Towards the end, I felt a burning sensation in my throat caused by the garlic and I couldn’t bring myself to finish my bowl.  My nephew said his bowl of chicken chop rice was okay but just average.  Disappointed."
Indulge,"Price is really one of the two pull factors here, the other one is the 50c cheese. Swear to God they have a pool of nacho cheese hiding behind ready to be served with all their food. Their popcorn is worth the try btw"
Indulge,"Quite a unique Western food coffeeshop stall. Has the typical Western food and even rice/soba. Would say it's fusion. Rice comes in 2 sizes. The mini bowl or the large one. The large one is normal size actually. Instead of sides, they serve popcorn, which is surprising. Prices are a bit more expensive than coffeeshop western food. Taste wise it's not bad."
Indulge,"The food is fine, I ordered chicken chop pasta (aglio olio) and added pasta. Unfortunately, I found a plastic thing in my food and really did not have the will to continue eating. Whoever is ordering pls be careful and I hope the chef does not make such a clumsy mistake again."
Indulge,"Speechless. I ordered a chicken chop rice bowl but received soba instead ok never mind but there was a STRAND OF HAIR on the chicken. Went back to the store, told them about the hair and they changed the soba for me. Halfway through my food, I found the same HAIR in my chicken. Look at the picture. Already called them out for the hair and they still put the same chicken in. The audacity even if you want to do your business like this don't let me find the hair??? Btw don't bother with this stall only their truffle pasta is edible."
Indulge,"Ordered their fish and chips that cost me $9.50. For a stall located in a coffeeshop, its just cut throat but I thought for that price, there would be a certain standard.  Anyway, when I collected my order I was appalled to see how thin, dry and heavily battered their fish was. To add on, their fries aka chips were downright cold.  I brought this up to the counter staff and he offered to swap the fish with chicken cutlet. No doubt, I appreciate that gesture but it didnt make much difference for the cutlet was mostly breading and not much meat.  Sadly, the meat was barely hot. In the end, I just gave up and threw away the rest of my meal. I cannot believe I paid close to $10 for such a sub standard meal."
Indulge,"Ordered pasta with chicken chop. The Aglio olio was perfect, however the chicken chop would be nice with some sauce to go with it, as it can be a bit dry"
Indulge,Ordered for pick up. Food is tasty and packed well
Indulge,tried some of the dishes. only the cream pasta is really good.
Indulge,Had their salmon and chicken chop. Nice big portions & taste good. Although the drinks are a bit pricy . 5 bucks for a coke. Love that they have a live band here. Quite a nice place to :smiling_face_with_sunglasses: chill
Indulge,Cafe in the clubhouse. Casual and relaxed vibes. It was a lazy weekend and we dropped by for lunch before bowling.  Staff was friendly and patient to us first timers. Order at the counter and pay first. Food will be served when ready.  I chose the chicken chop with fries. Prices are reasonable and my main dish was under $10. They have fusion pasta such as hae bee hiam pasta with teriyaki chicken. Portion is generous. Loved the truffle and mushroom pasta. Tasted the best amongst all our orders.  The salmon mentaiko took the longest to arrive at the table.
Indulge,Came for the 4 for 3 special deal and Celebrate twins’ birthday - staff very helpful to give us 2 tables for all our stuff for 5 pax :thumbs_up_light_skin_tone:
Indulge,"Reasonable pricing, generous thick slices of glistening smoked duck made my mouth waters. Served very fast shortly after order is placed. Nice ambience and comfortable seats."
Indulge,"Casual self service western grill, pretty empty during Monday lunch, I enjoyed the garlic scampi in the salad and the beef patty in the burger which was a huge serving. Easy open space parking at location."
Indulge,"Ordered Australian Marbled Steak takeaway at price of $18.30, received a small piece of thin meat. Fries side by side in comparison. Last time visiting."
Indulge,"Decent local western food @ Ubi area. Menu had a lot of the popular options and a wide variety too.  Ordered the Hae bee hiam pasta with 2 chicken thighs ($9). Portion is generous enough as a main and the chicken is tender, almost comparable to the best of fast food chains. Hae bee hiam is mildly spicy so you can’t really feel the heat and just enough salt + sweet combination.  Fries ($3.90)were overkill with the 2 types of cheese sauce but at least they were generous."
Indulge,"Surprised by the poor reviews from other users. Had the grilled chicken in mushroom sauce with an onsen egg, and swapped the rice for salad comprising romaine lettuce and tomatoes for $7.50. Very wholesome meal and generous portions.  Smoked duck in cranberry sauce wasn’t up to mark as the cranberry sauce tasted oddly medicinal.  PS: Don’t order via food delivery as there’s a big 45% markup on the food prices to benefit the greedy food delivery companies, and this isn’t including any delivery charges yet."
Indulge,"Located inside DMQ eating house. We tried their grilled chicken bowl with black pepper sauce. Portions were good - plenty of chicken, corn, edamame beans & a nice soft-boil egg. Black pepper sauce was good and I like how they use the short-grain rice. They still have plenty of western food options on their menu. Hope to try more next time :thumbs_up_medium-light_skin_tone:"
Indulge,"Ordered a chicken with spaghetti take out. The moment I was about to eat, saw a small cockroach in the food container. Immediately throw it away. Tried to call the shop to inform them about this matter but then no chance of being answered. So then decide to leave a review in here. If you (the owner) have read this review, please take care of the hygiene of the stall ASAP."
Indulge,"The mushroom truffle bowl was extremely garlicky with lots of raw garlic. Considering the taste and portion, i think its too expensive. Service was bad and very rude too. Would not come back :("
Indulge,"Was a huge supporter for the truffle mushroom aglio olio when it first open, seasoning everything was good till the stall keep changing staff, throughout the changing of staff period i have been ordering the dish to the point where i find it tasteless. No seasoning at all. Its not once but happen alot of time. If your staff doesnt have the motivation to even cook properly please change the staff again as the staff that was there when you first open had the heart for cooking and even remembering faces with order"
Indulge,"Looks promising at first with Seth Lui accreditation at the front. If you just want to fill your stomach at that price, this is the place for you. If not, please save your money."
Indulge,"I have been dining here 2 days in a row now. 1st day: my first plate of black pepper duck pasta was so good, I had to try something else and we ordered the Truffle Mushroom pasta. Don't get me wrong, they score well for hawker food quality. However I came back today and ordered the same black pepper duck pasta and was disappointed. The taste is still as good, but the pasta portion is too small of a handful and left me unfilled and dissatisfied. I really hope the intended portion isn't supposed to be this small because 1. I actually live 5 mins away from them and 2. the food is actually not bad, BUT it will defeat the purpose of me ordering it if it doesn't fill me at all. For now its 4 stars until I see whats the intended portion size, but will be back to re-rate it if it still remains that same small handful."
Indulge,"They’re always busy playing mobile games and don’t pay attention when taking orders. Also take quite long to prepare the order. There was one time the staff mixed up my order and instead of redoing it, he said he’s giving me the sides for free??? I ordered chicken chop bowl which should come with edamame, corn and onsen egg. Instead, I got fries, coleslaw and RICE (which is supposed to be in the bowl)  :face_with_tears_of_joy: how is that “free sides”? Not recommended :thumbs_down_medium-light_skin_tone::thumbs_down_medium-light_skin_tone::thumbs_down_medium-light_skin_tone::thumbs_down_medium-light_skin_tone::thumbs_down_medium-light_skin_tone:"
Indulge,Therapist Lisa is very skilful and knowledgeable. The whole duration is healing and therapeutic as she focuses on my pain issue. Consultant Jasmine is professional and friendly. She gives advises and customised package to my needs. No hard selling or pushy.  Overall experience is amazing. It's a 6 out of 5star. Strongly recommend
Indulge,"Very hard sell. While the therapist was skilled, the service by the therapist was very inconsistent. Therapist was using their phone during the session itself, for an extended period of time. This happened quite often (I was a regular). I would not recommend this place to anyone, please look elsewhere."
Indulge,"First they ask you to sign massage package saying it is basic. So u can enjoy right? No, after a while, hard sell you one by one. Sign yuting package then ask u to sign niujiao package then aijiu package They can earn more this way. Then after u kinda finish, ask u to sign a combo package which u can do massage, yuting etc. Because this is when u realise no point to have so many packages. And even u said no, u have to endure they ask and ask, lower the package price and sessions till u sign. Once u agree, they are like super fast to prepare your bill. Best is dont bring your credit debit cards and remove cards from phone app too for each visit. So u have time to think and not being pushed to make a decision.  The masseue hard sells during massage, super pushy also. Not just mentioning one time, keep saying will help u, oh u have this problem. Be firm. If you insist dont wanna sign new package, then they will ask u to fork out an amount maybe $100 plus to try a treatment not in your package. Just stop chatting with them and ignore. Cos they want cash from u. Every period they have some treament under so called promo they want to sell.  Oh ya, if u said u dont wanna pay to try a new treatment not in your package, then they will ask u to deduct between 2 and 4 sessions of your package for one stupid new treatment so they make u finish your package sooner. Not worth it I have done this few times stupid me. Now i know their tricks. Firm no.  They wont be satisfied with just the package u signed they will think of way to suck more money from each visit. Creating stress and a hole in your pocket after most visits. So no point to patronise unless u willing to spend as they treat their existing customers like this.  Treatment is good and i really wish to continue my package but due to these tactics and I always need to be on guards and be a defensive soldier to fight against their pushy tactics and guard my money, i will not patronise when my ard 1 year package finishes. I wont step into a salon that has sells package anymore. I signed up because of muscle and joint issues. I am waiting for the day to run cos I have no peace with this salon."
Indulge,I have serious back pain and their machine massage instantly relief the pain that i am having for years. THIS IS AMAZING. highly recommend this spa. I look forward to be back for my next session!!
Indulge,"The staff were professional and the service was exceptional,especially therapist Ms Dyonne was very experienced and attentive.She provide helpful,detailed explanation on my body pain issues.Highly recommended!"
Indulge,
Indulge,First time visiting this place. It was worth the experience! Receptionist Alicia was friendly and informative. Did a 1hr body massage and enjoyed it. Place is clean and well maintained. Will definitely come back again..
Indulge,Friendly staff n good masseuses. Treatment room is spacious. Sales aren't pushy. Good experience.
Indulge,"I went to the outlet at star vista! From the receptionist to the 2 ladies working on mani and pedi.. Everyone was super friendly and nice. No hard selling at all. And special shout out to Christy who did pedi. I had pretty rough, dry feet.. And she patiently scrubbed and worked her magic to give me such nice nails and feet. Very grateful to their incredible service. Thank you :smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes:"
Indulge,"Classic Mani-Pedi! This is the first time I have tried this venue and I had an positive experience right from the start. The staff were extremely welcoming. The appointment started on time. My therapists were Angel and Joma and they provided a professional service and excellent job. They constantly made sure that I was comfortable, especially in the massage chair. I am really happy with the service and I would definitely recommend it. I cannot wait to be pampered again! Thank you so much"
Indulge,Candy has magic hands! Provides the best facial  massage and always so delicate with my eye lashes. Ask for Candy if youre a first timer and you'll never go anywhere else.
Indulge,Pleasant experience. Mani-pedi is good especially the gel one- last after multiple wash(3 times and no complaints) The facial is also good - comfortable and pleasant staff. Brought their package and can be used over long term. Friendly and professional.
Indulge,"I purchased a pain management massage through fave and it was a wonderful experience! No hardselling, the staff were incredibly helpful and the massage service was incredibly good. I've been having bad backaches from long hours at the desk and from working out regularly. Fantastic service! will definitely patronize again."
Indulge,"Design of stall front was very nice. However food was horrible. Had the fish n chips, although fish meat itself is good (because pollock), the cooking skill is way off. Batter was still white, fries were also white. All the food looks bland, and tastes bland. Below average western stall, and charges high price ($9.50) for fish n chips."
Indulge,One of the rare western food stall that offers a bowl option where you can hv a salad base! Great when you want a meal that has more veg and not heavy!
Indulge,"I come here for the salmon bowl with rice or soba. Brain booster with a lot of Omega 3s. $9.50 and add $3 salmon, is what you get as shown in my photo."
Indulge,"We had spaghetti- grilled chicken in cream and mariana sauce. The pasta is too bland, cream one was creamy and quite tasteless. Mariana was slightly better. Good portion of pasta and grilled chicken, but overall disappointed. Will not be back anytime soon."
Indulge,"I would rate a 2 Stars. Food ok only. Not fantastic. Price slightly on the high side as it is in a coffee shop. I had the chicken chop. They don't have mashed potatoes. If you opt for Sweet Potatoes fries, add $1.50. Their Coleslaw way too creamy. I was like eating Mayonnaise Cream. The chicken don't have that Wowwwww taste. I have yet to try their pasta."
Indulge,The friendly owner has recently moved from old Tanglin Shopping Centre much crowded place good place & location good :thumbs_up_light_skin_tone: business :man_office_worker: all the best boss!
Indulge,"Very friendly owner homely feel of this store in the heart of Tanglin Orchard, will definitely like to show some support buying more groceries, biscuits, munchies, drinks here, it’s really convenient besides 711 and Cheers. Prices are reasonable :thumbs_up_light_skin_tone::smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes:"
Huat Heng Fried Oyster,"Took a long while before order to pickup plate good or lua, good food takes time like wine hint of wine, lots of labor & love uncle really takes time to fry from scratch caramelized the crispy tapioca starch edges eggs remain moist with lots of chives takes skill and patience when time is money uncle remains honest plate by plate alas use fresh local oysters hard to find near extinct, small and expensive cannot get enough of them only pay $$$ to get more else choose other stall for plump Korean ones slurp slurp slurp cannot enjoy need to stop, chew and taste then can eat more"
Huat Heng Fried Oyster,Acceptable for oyster omelette but lots of room for improvement especially since their smallest portion is relatively pricey. Overall it should be fried more so that it’s more crispy. The chili was better than average surprisingly.
Huat Heng Fried Oyster,"Price, taste, quantity, ingredients - all average. Not mindblowing but nothing to bash them about as well. This was $8 portion."
Huat Heng Fried Oyster,"Worst Orh Lua I've ever tasted. Starch and eggs were undercooked, no wok hei taste whatsoever. We bought the small portion at $5 and were only given 2 pieces of oyster. This place doesn't deserve the Michelin Guide recommendation. Don't bother travelling to whampoa FC just to try this. You can make it at home yourself, mix corn starch and eggs together, toss in imaginary oysters and fry for 1 second. It should taste exactly the same as this. Meme Rating: My disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined."
Huat Heng Fried Oyster,"The orh luak was very great and the wok hei taste was really good (it tasted super smokey).  Maybe I had the last one made for the day, that's why"
Tha Chang Noodle Bar,"We had a fantastic dinner experience at this restaurant! We opted for the pork boat noodles and the hotpot for two. The tom yum mama hotpot had a delightful, fiery kick to it, while the pork boat noodles' broth struck a perfect balance between saltiness and sweetness. The male staff who attended to us were incredibly accommodating, but unfortunately, the service from the other female staff really fell short. Not friendly, not helpful.  One minor drawback was the weak signal inside the restaurant, which caused some difficulties while trying to place our food orders. It would be beneficial if the staff assisted customers in the ordering process and offered more attentive service. Despite that, we highly recommend this place for its delicious food and overall enjoyable experience."
Tha Chang Noodle Bar,I don’t like the boat noodles (pork) here. The soup has a unique taste & a tinge of coconut which I hate. And it’s very salty and sweet. 4 out of 5 in my group doesn’t like it too. However I might try the rice dishes in future as they look nice. Oh and the papaya salad is so spicy - I don’t like it too :(
Tha Chang Noodle Bar,"If intensely savory and flavorful stuff eaten with gold-plated utensils is not your thing then skip this place. May be too savory for some low salt tastebuds. The pork boat noodle broth is damn power, thai rice noodles so nicely chewy, sliced pork, pork balls, pork belly, all decent but I wish they added more veggie, and the mango salad is pretty spicy with crispy anchovies and crispy micro shrimps but small portion for the price. I’d usually tell them ped nit noi when they were at Golden Mile but I forgot and tongue kena whack but damn shiok. Quite reasonable to slightly pricey dishes (at this location). Friendly service. This place for many folks would prob be a go to for solid Thai cuisine."
Tha Chang Noodle Bar,"Really love the boat Noodle there. Best Thai Boat Noodle in Singapore, a must have in Singapore! Broth is so flavourful, filled with lots of ingredient! Staffs were very kind and patient, all of them were friendly. The ambience feels so much like I'm in Thailand, vintage meets modern. A must visit for everyone!!"
Tha Chang Noodle Bar,"My all time favourite and go-to thai boat noodles place! Their broth is packed with very rich flavours, every mouth packs a punch. Not only is their boat noodles a bomb, their tom yum and raw seafood platter are really good as well. Tom yum soup is spicy and flavourful. The raw seafood platter had really fresh ingredients and the sauce was limy, spicy and salty. All the dishes I’ve tried hit the spot. I love this place and have recommended this to all my friends."
Ms Durian,"Beautiful cafe with lovely interior decor. Service was warm and friendly and food was great!!! Durian desserts are palatable even for non-lovers, but durian lovers might wish for a stronger punch. Still a great place to hang out for couple dates or with friends."
Ms Durian,There's indoor and outdoor sitting. Very nice environment. Durian shake is a must try. Durain coffee so so... Durian cake if missed nothing to regret. Tiramisu is another dessert not to be missed. Damage done; about more than sgd 30 per person is on the expensive side for just desserts and drinks.
Ms Durian,"First time here with friends for desserts and drinks. The desserts were unique and yummy, we especially like the Creme Brulee which come with ice cream. The service crew (KP and Ivan) were also very friendly and nice. We will definitely come here again =)"
Ms Durian,First time here and the staff were very nice esp. Ms. Adeline Lee.  We told here we got old folks and would like to sit inside as we did not do any reservation. She is so kind to accede to our request.  We were a bit late and the durian cheese cake were sold out so we took the normal durian cake which tasted as good.   The rest of the food we ordered were yummy too.  We highly recommend this place to anyone who wish to have a dessert and love durians.
Ms Durian,"Durian~lious food at Ms. Durian with Great Array of Durian desserts and the main dish are also nice, presentation and well commendable. I would definitely come back again with my friends and family."
Haengbok Cakeyo,"The fruits on the cake was abit sour while the cream and dough eaten together was nice, as in not too creamy or dry or wet. The fatcarons was nice and i can taste the flavors it was meant to be, especially the ondeh ondeh which had gula melaka. However, it was quite sweet, maybe from the biscuit and cream. I'm not an expert on pastries and sweets, just my 2 cents.  I like the brownie, which is rich to the chocolate side. I ate it cold although they suggested to make hot, but it was still nice.  Price wise i find it reasonable: the fatcarons was $20 for 4, brownie at $7, and cake at $14."
Haengbok Cakeyo,"안녕하세요 :woman_gesturing_OK: i am Serena, the founder behind Haengbok Cakeyo. Of course, I would give my own brand a 5 stars. Can sounds really biased but i will justify why i give my own bakery a 5-stars.  I started baking 13 years back, out of passion and also my love for desserts (to an extent, my mother will be puzzled why i can still eat cakes even though i am baking and facing cakes almost everyday). I told my mom, its the same logic as you facing me everyday, it is called LOVE :face_with_tears_of_joy:. ,  Like many people, i learnt by myself and bake from home. Started really small, selling small quantities to my friends and words slowly spread. There were ups and downs, uncertainty, fear and of course satisfying moments. Its always roller coaster. 4 years back, i bravely decided to open my own bakery-cum-baking studio located here at 41 Kampong Bahru Rd. Sometimes i always wonder how miracle it is that i am still surviving.  It is actually NOT A MIRACLE. It is a lot of hardwork, persistency, blood, sweat and tears. Which most people will not see it. I was trained in Korea and have been introducing 'Korean Desserts trends' to Singapore. Haengbok Cakeyo was recently launched and its a new takeaway desserts concept store focusing on just korean style desserts. Menu took me and my team a lot of time and materials to create. We put in lots of efforts from brainstorming flavs to branding to marketing to revamping the whole space into korean vibes. I really wish everyone can see what we have done.  I really appreciate people who gave us thumbs up and constantly supporting us. For those whom we cant satisfy, all i can say is i am truly sorry to disappoint and i am not able to satisfy everyone's taste buds.  All in all, it is for you to judge if you like it or not. Feedback/reviews are always welcome and beneficial for us to make improvements where necessary.  The whole team and i will continue to work hard and create flavours of Korea specially for Singapore.  화이팅!"
Haengbok Cakeyo,"Ridiculously expensive! The macarons looked much bigger in the photos - but in reality, they were just 2 regular-sized macaron shells with 2 layers of cream. A single fatfatcaron would set you back $5.80 :face_screaming_in_fear:  The only one worth trying was the Orh Nee Fatfatcaron, with the taro paste and coconut jelly. The others were uninspiring, and really sweet. My least favorite was the one with the fruity pebbles, which was simply 2 thick layers of cream cheese with a sprinkle of fruity pebbles :/"
Haengbok Cakeyo,"Definitely The Best Macaron you can find in Singapore. It taste even better than those I have tasted in Korea, is not too sweet and the cream is really fresh.  Specially order The Earl Grey Macaron for myself and my friend. Ordered a dessert set for mother’s Day, love the Refreshing Yuzu Chiffon Cake, matcha strawberry fatfatcarons!"
Haengbok Cakeyo,"Super yums! Ordered twice in a week. My new fav gifts because you can customize quantities & flavours depending on what the person will like. My personal fav is Blueberry Fatfatcaroons, nice combi of refreshing sweet and sour :)"
Shi Wei Da,"It's been quite a while since I last had it. Was an OMO until 7:30pm when the lady arrived to help out, hence shortening the waiting time. Quite mediocre this time round, thou have to admit the ingredients are fresh. I would be queueing again for the taste. But many might disagree as your don't find this type of value pricing at $3 and $4 serving that sort of quantity...."
Shi Wei Da,"Please expect to queue at least 30 to 45 minutes not because there is a super long queue. But there is only 1 uncle doing all the food cooking and packing. But at $4, it was a huge plate of satay bee hoon. The peanut gravy was good, very peanuty and not sandy/grainy like I have eaten at other places.  Only let down is there is no cuttlefish! Will be great with cuttlefish."
Shi Wei Da,$3 to $5. $4 portion is gigantic! But no cockles. Recommend to eat there. I package dinner and gravy was less savoury at home.
Shi Wei Da,"I am not a big fan of Satay Bee Hoon (rice vermicelli), but seeing this stall always has a long queue, finally I can’t resist the temptation any more to give it a try. For $4, there is insane amount of fresh ingredients - tau pok, tau gay, pork slices and liver, and also kangkong and perfectly cooked bee hoon. What I like in particular is the thick and rich satay sauce that is not oily at all. It gives such a wholesome and satisfying feeling after the meal.  An interesting thing to note is that the uncle stops selling roughly slightly after 8pm, even though there are still leftover ingredients."
Shi Wei Da,"Popular satay bee hoon stall. Be prepared to queue up for at least 30-45mins after 5:30pm. Serving portions come in $3, $4 and $5. In my opinion, the $3 or $4 portion should suffice. The $5 plate is more like a shared platter with a couple. Serving comes generous amounts of sliced pork, pork liver, tau pok, kang kong and bee hoon, all doused with slightly spicy peanut gravy. Yummy, and worth the long wait!"
Hong Style Fried Rice,"Delicious Pork Chop Fried Rice at a very reasonable price! The serving of the pork chop was really generous. Good mix of fats and lean meat in the pork chop led to a chewy yet fulfilling experience. The fried rice was a little oily, but its strong fragrance and taste made up for it. Chili is available on the side, could've been spicier. It's a steal at $6.50!"
Hong Style Fried Rice,"Generous slices of pork chop in the rice. Each piece of the pork chop was juicy and flavourful. But I personally felt it was a bit too salty for me. Their fried rice was really good, not too dry nor it not too wet, right texture. The service was quick, waiting time wasn't long. Prices was kept affordable too."
Hong Style Fried Rice,"Tried the Ipoh curry noodles the last time round and saw this stall but was too early and wasn't opened yet. This time went around lunchtime and decided to try after hearing it was opened by some ex DTF chef. There was no queue but I guess there were quite a lot of orders before me so I waited for like 15 minutes before I collected the fried rice. Only ordered one which was the golden egg fried rice with pork chop. 1st look it looks similar to the one served in DTF, however it lacks the shiny appearance which is good because it tasted less oily than the DTF one. Can't believe the dish was so simple but executed so well. Rice was very well fried and fragrant and the pork chop was a rather big portion. Think its half the price of the restaurant and very worth it! Would definitely come back again for the other options."
Hong Style Fried Rice,"Queue is really long but I think for the price and the taste, it's quite worth it.  Paid $6.70 for the garlic fried rice with pork chop and the rice is actually really nice!  The pork chop is quite close to Din Tai Fung's except it is a bit more chewy. Otherwise, smell and taste is actually pretty close.  Overall, a good experience!"
Hong Style Fried Rice,Value for money and tasty pork chop eggs fried rice. Quite popular and sometimes long queue but service is quite fast.
Hong Style Fried Rice,Garlic egg fried rice with pork chop damn good! Must eat with their chili also! $7 for this portion damn worth!
Hong Style Fried Rice,"I am writing in to compliment the staff working on 29/03/2023 between 12pm to 2pm. Ordered a serving of dark soy sauce fried rice with prawn. However the staff intentionally inform that the dish was short of prawns and added a mixture of luncheon meat instead. Though a small gesture, but it reflects on the integrity not to shortchange customers. Turns out, the fried rice with prawn and luncheon meat was delicious as well. Thank you very much for your honesty."
Hong Style Fried Rice,"Bought 3 times from them so far and I would give it a 4.5 stars actually. The fried rice is tasty and the amount of ingredients were generous. However, some improvement could be made. the pork chop is a little salty. I ordered twice with additional chinese sausage, the chinese sausage could be fried longer or maybe a better grade lupcheong could be used to improve the taste further. Will I buy again? YES, it is still (kind of) reasonable pricing for such fried rice. But comparing to the nearby hawker and coffeeshops, $6.50 is probably on the higher side. Looking forward to more improvements or maybe even more variations available."
Hong Style Fried Rice,Abit disappointed. The fried rice smells fragrant. But unfortunately their pork meat is tough. Price is reasonable.
Hong Style Fried Rice,"10/10 WOULD RECOMMEND. I seldom write any reviews, but hong style fried rice deserves all my 5 stars. Amazing garlic fried rice with pork chop - honestly it’s so much nicer than DTF and KOFR omg please stay in Kallang Bahru forever!!!"
Hong Style Fried Rice,"They use short-grain rice, very well-fried and well-coated with lots of eggs! It’s not oily and there was no crumbly bits at all. I also added luncheon meat cubes for additional $2!! Yum!!! As for the pork chop, it’s tender and peppery and the portion was huge and thick! My only complaint is the chilli, it’s watery and it’s not spicy at all. :grinning_face_with_sweat: Overall it’s still a very good pork chop egg fried rice and I will definitely return for more. :thumbs_up: **They also accept CDC vouchers so you can consider to utilise them in this stall! :thumbs_up:"
Hong Style Fried Rice,"Visited the coffeeshop for an early lunch before the peak hour crowds so seats are available and it is relatively quite cooling. I spotted a new relatively new stall and decided to give it a try. Ordering was quite fast even though there was a short queue. When I saw the food, I was surprised as the meat looks like a huge portion. The meat is well seasoned and the rice is fragrant. The chilli sauces available are also nice!"
Hong Style Fried Rice,"Saw it, got excited. Did not try the amk branch. Got it on grab.  Looks nice, pork is nice.  The rice however... not sure who they got but its kinda bland. Looks like king of fried rice but its slightly tasteless compared to wok hey. Slightly diaappointed on that front"
Hong Style Fried Rice,The pork chop fried rice was yummy! The chefs were very friendly too. Would definitely come back again for more.
Hong Style Fried Rice,"Better than king of fried rice. Pork chop is tender, rice is fragrant but a little wet. Gives 2 kinds of chilli."
Hong Style Fried Rice,"These dishes may not look like much, but damn they were good! Fresh, yummy, value-for-money… what more can I ask for?! Will definitely be back to try more dishes. For now, recommend!  Pictured: - Stir-fried clams - Cantonese-style steamed whole grouper - Salted fish steamed pork - Sang Cao Har (light soya sauce prawns)  :round_pushpin:: Hong Kong Style Kitchen @ Blk 93 Lor 4 #01-44 Singapore 310094"
Hong Style Fried Rice,"Best Cantonese/ HK style steam fish, well cooked (not over cooked), fish is fresh, tender and juicy. Fairly priced with generous toppings of parsley, spring onion and fragrant soy sauce. Highly recommend."
Hong Style Fried Rice,"Be prepared to queue for your food. I arrived at 5.30 pm and reached the end of the queue at around 6.30 pm. We order steam fish head, meat biscuit, lor han chye, vegetable with pork, fried prawn, and Har cheong Kai. The fish are fresh, vegetables have wok hei , meat biscuit and Har cheong Kai  is tasty. The total bill for 6 pax is $64.50. Strongly recommended."
Hong Style Fried Rice,"Went to tabao dinner for Mothers day, stall opens at 430pm , reached there around 4pm, order started around 420, i was the 3rd in line. There is no official menu, so you can look at google reviews for its dishes, or ask the shop owners. They speak cantonese and a bit of mandarin, so be prepared. Ordered the famous steam fish, 石斑 this time， sometimes have 青衣， taste good. Price cheap only $15-20 for whole fish. Also ordered the fried prawn 炒虾碌，$15 taste great smells great. $8 咕噜肉，quite sweet, little sour, meat is soft. Love it. $8 :eggplant:鸡肉， its fantastic. A little sweet from the :eggplant:， my fav dish of the day. Total cost was $49 for 4 dishes. Take away boxes no extra charges. Waiting time around 30-40 mins as 3rd person in line.  Ps. The la la was from the stall beside, as the la la for this stall is sold out. The 1st in queue ordered the last. Cost $8 tastes good. Wait time is short."
Hong Style Fried Rice,"I must have been living under the rock, not to have discover this stall.  Maybe it's because we don't live in this area.  Health Promotion Board ought to have an award (as opposed to Michelin-stars) for hawkers like Mr Tang who is whipping out healthy excellent, fresh, and reasonable-priced dishes to the community. His wife and him are exactly the type of foreigners Singapore wants. They bring a slice of their HK culinary skills to Singapore and ensuring that the community eats well (note: most of the hawker food are unhealthy: oily, carbs & sodium laden).  It's my first visit today. We ordered: 1. Cantonese-style steamed grouper - Super fresh and super smooth. Way better than the ones in Chinatown. Restaurant standard. 2. Fried Pork with Yam - Very flavourful. Home-cooked feel. 3. Fried Big Prawns - The prawns are fresher than some restaurants. Restaurant standard.  This is NOT a regular Zi Char stall. It's many cuts above the rest. It amazes me how the chef can juggle with so many variety in his small little ""kitchen""!  We'd be back again to try other dishes! Thank you for blessing the community. For this quality and pricing,  the margins are razor-blade thin."
Hong Style Fried Rice,"One of the best fried rice we have ever eaten!! :face_savoring_food: Ordered the Garlic Fried Rice with Shrimp and Dark Sauce Fried Rice with Luncheon Meat! Both tasted fantastic with the wok hey taste, but the garlic one stood out more! :smiling_face_with_heart-eyes: Location is at a industrial building's coffeeshop with parking right outside :thumbs_up_light_skin_tone: If you love garlic, we highly recommend the Garlic Fried Rice! :hundred_points:"
Hong Style Fried Rice,"This was astonishingly scrumptious!!! The stall was tiny and tucked away in the corner, so I almost missed it, but this was such a hidden gem!!  I got the Egg Fried Rice with Spicy Chicken Chop:  The fried rice was pretty good and flavorful, reminded me of Wok Hei/King of Fried Rice's version, but less greasy! So I enjoyed this more :heart_hands_light_skin_tone:  The spicy chicken chop was the ultimate MVP!!!! W O W it tasted like a crunchier McSpicy I was shooketh!! Perfectly fried skin, absolutely tender chicken thigh with a nice kick from the spice - it was reminiscent of the McSpicy cutlet I love but even better cuz crunchier omg :loudly_crying_face:  SO G O O D I will go back just for this chicken chop alone!!"
Hong Style Fried Rice,"Lots of amount of eggs in my fried rice. Very very flavourful. Meat is a little tad salty. Considering 1 person tending the store (cashier + cook), service was still good."
Hong Style Fried Rice,"Decent attempt at a reasonable price, but ultimately you still get for what you pay for. Pork chop is decent, but lacks a certain chewiness and meatiness, and the rice here is a bit mushy. Overall, Din Tai Fung is still better and tastier."
Hong Style Fried Rice,Yummy! delicious
Hong Style Fried Rice,My usual dapao place for dinner when I have guest in town.  Good prawn paste chicken and XO fish soup noodle and hor fun.  Favourite to order is the crab bee hoon dry style.  Dining there is not as pleasant and eating at home is more enjoyable for my family.
Hong Style Fried Rice,"Went there on a Saturday night and it wasn't too crowded. However, the food took really long to come. They also cooked the sotong wrongly because we had ordered cereal flavour but it was salted egg.  Taste wise, the food was quite nice. The sambal sweet potato leaves were flavourful, while the curry fish head was tasty and the sauce wasn't diluted. It was also spicier than we expected, which was great because some curry fish head can be quite bland. While there was too much batter for the sotong, the sotong itself was quite nice.  I would say that if anyone wants to come to this place for some family dinner or gathering, it wouldn't be the best choice because it's located right next to the road. This means that it's pretty hard to hold a conversation with the incessant roaring of motorcycle and car engines right next to you."
Hong Style Fried Rice,Just want to try their fish head bee hoon to fix my craving . Good standard for the fish head and robust soup . I have tried various outlets and standard is consistent.  The order taker was not friendly and bit impatient in taking my order ( instruction ) . Guess they sell food but not service :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing::rolling_on_the_floor_laughing::rolling_on_the_floor_laughing: Will hesitate for return visits .
Hong Style Fried Rice,"A no non-sense Chinese style “street” food with a little restaurant flare.  The “San Lao” Hor Fun is a must try (stir-fried flat rice noodles with fish & bean sprouts gravy sauce).  Expect a little waiting time if there are a lot of people.  Pass your time waiting for food by watching the service ladies talking (or shouting?) to each other in Chinese.  Recommended for cheap, local eats."
Hong Style Fried Rice,"Clearly the food here is pretty good, especially the fish soup bee Hoon. The other dishes such as Thai tofu is nice as well. Downside of the place is that the seating comfort is pretty poor. And staff service is just simply atrocious, rude and unwelcoming. And food serving just takes such a long time despite the place being quite empty."
Hong Style Fried Rice,"This place is quite popular with the locals. While the area is being upgraded, it is not very accessible. I do like the Prawn Minced Meat Rolls and Sweet Sour Sliced Fish are excellent options. Baby Kai Lan is too hard for older people. Coffee Pork Rib is a bit bland. Cereal Prawns are pretty lovely. Home-Made Tofu with Minced Meat is disappointing - while the meat is flavourful, the tofu doesn’t absorb the flavour, so you get a too salty feeling from the meat, but the tofu is tasteless. The salted fish fried rice is well received, so do try it."
Hong Style Fried Rice,"Consistently good. One can always count on them for a delicious meal! Black bean beef hor fun, prawn paste chicken, fish slice soup and cereal squid are the best!"
Hong Style Fried Rice,"A chain tze char outlet which you can find across the island. Though not all outlets serve good food. Affordable tze char fare along novena. Nothing to shout about but its definitely above average. The restaurant was considerably filled on a Sunday night at 8ish when other restaurants were closing for the day.  If you're in the vicinity and looking for some tze char, I'd recommend this restaurant."
Hong Style Fried Rice,"Service is very friendly and helpful. Food tastes very good - everything is well seasoned! Our favorites were the Yang Zhou Fried Rice (ask for their sambal, it has a nice belacan flavour which goes well with the rice), the coffee ribs, and also their fish dishes like the Assam fish slice and Gong Bao fish slice. I don't like prawn paste chicken but they do it so light and non-oily here which is very rare! I think it's worth a try. The price point is very reasonable. Four folks with fried rice, fried hor fun, a fish slice, a veggie a pork rib and prawn paste chicken (and rice drinks) set us back $98."
Hong Style Fried Rice,A pretty okay zichar place. Their coffee pork ribs is quite burst :collision: .. But the cutlery bowls and plates are dirty even changing for the third time..
Hong Style Fried Rice,Good fish soup noodles. Soup is tasty and smooth Fried fish is thick and ok Noodles is good Not much service oriented Normal coffee shop style
Hong Style Fried Rice,"The price of a medium portion of fish head soup has increased from $12 to $14, a small bowl of rice increased from $1 to $1.20 and a fried egg cost $1.20... On top of that they hv started to charge additional 8% Gst & 1% service charge. On average the price has increased by 25% per meal ! Will think twice B4 coming again.... Actually not worth to pay additional 9% to dine at a neighborhood non aircon eatery outlet."
Hong Style Fried Rice,"Bought a large 咸菜汤 for family dinner at $18.30, but we couldn’t drink it as the soup and ingredients is full of mama-lemon dishwashing detergent taste. I wanted to give a 0 star rating, but the lowest is 1 star. For safety and health reason, I will never come back again to this restaurant to dine-in or take out."
Hong Style Fried Rice,"Ordered takeaway (salted vege soup, 咸菜汤, $18.30), the soup has a strong soap detergent taste. It's either the wok used to boil the soup is not wash thoroughly or they used soap as an ingredient.  I am never coming back. :("
Hong Style Fried Rice,"Had the fried tang hoon with seafood, with the 'boing' to it, and it was not soggy or overcooked at all.  It was quite tasty even more so if it is paired with sliced chilli padi, that adds the heat to it. Went there during off peak hours so there was not a lot of people around, so it was pretty easy getting a table.  Nice and windy place, good for a relaxing afternoon kopi hangout."
Hong Style Fried Rice,Hong Kong style Zi Char from the crew at Blk 151 previously. The Cantonese style cooking is delicious and tasty. Sticking with their popular dishes are the way to go!
Hong Style Fried Rice,"Braised pork yee mee is very delicious, hor fun has a bit of wok hey too. Chai poh egg is a bit too salty. I prefer Prawn paste chicken, black bean fish and kangkung cuttle fish are better"
Hong Style Fried Rice,"Decided to have family dinner at Zhen Ji located in Ang Mo Kio Avenue 4.  The coffee shop where Zhen Ji was located was pretty busy when we arrived there at 6:30pm.  In the kitchen of Zhen Ji, 5 chefs were busy dishing out the orders placed by diners.  Besides the sliced fish beehoon soup (with milk) which we came to savor, we ordered the Har Jeong Gai, Hae Zhor, Sambal Kangkong, Stir fried beef and Hotplate Tofu with minced pork.  The Sliced Fish Beehoon Soup (with milk) was lacking fish bone flavor. They were generous with beehoon but the 5 pieces of sliced fish were overcooked.we could taste mild wine flavor in the soup.  The Har Jeong Gai although well fried and crispy was not seasoned sufficiently. Chicken meat wasn’t tasty, maybe lack of prawn paste.  The Hae Zhor was crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside - but lacking minced prawn. We felt the filling was mixed with too much flour.  The Hotplate Tofu with minced pork was delicious. Very well done with beaten eggs at the bottom of the tofu.  The stir fried beef was tender but somehow didn’t have the beefy taste.  Overall, the meal was okay. For 7 adults and two kids, it cost us $149.50. Inexpensive."
Hong Style Fried Rice,"The supposedly “owner” or the boss (an uncle in white top) attitude was bad! Immediately we arrived, he told us if we have not made a reservation, we go sit outside (under the Sun), what a different attitude vs people who made a reservation!!! In the end we managed to grab a seat inside the “non booking zone”… to make thing worst… after sitting down for 5 mins a lady walked pass us and says there’s a rat :rat: running past us! Holly sh*t!!! One guy in black (looks like supervisor) saw it and claimed that there’s a market nearby so it’s kind of common!? :man_facepalming_light_skin_tone: last time here I guess!"
Hong Style Fried Rice,Very nice tze char store. Tried a few dishes and they’re all pretty good and none were disappointing. Saw that the san lao hor fun and prawn paste chicken was popular from the reviews. The chicken was very crispy and juicy. The $6 fried rice portion is huge and worth it too. You can also call to order in advanced and collect it once it’s ready.
Hong Style Fried Rice,"Food taste super bland. Ordered 6 dishes only crab is decent.  Spilled chilli twice, once on the table on over the dish act like nothing happen just walk away.  Wouldn’t come back again."
Hong Style Fried Rice,"not bad but not that good... quite average  there are other zi char options out there which are cheaper and tastier ordered the fried french beans, salted egg prawns and hor fan  french beans and salad egg prawns were quite nice but soso only la (reco getting the prawns if you're coming) hor fan was ok I guess... tasted a little bland and it didn't have the wok hey taste  service is also lacking, theyre not friendly and look very done with you  I'll give this a 5/10"
Hong Style Fried Rice,"Used to give them good grade but no longer. Today's & previous visits, food doesn't taste as good as used to be. Main chief had left. Price are surely too expensive for coffee shop stall."
Hong Style Fried Rice,"Love the tze char store. They are super duper pack during dinner and weekends, but surprisingly, the wait is not too long. Kitchen staffs highly trained fast hand fast leg. You would expect a slight drop in quality, but it has maintained its own standard despite preparing food faster. Service staffs are also happy to serve you, unlike some stores which gives you black faces when they’re too busy. I would highly recommend to try them out!"
Hong Style Fried Rice,"Waited for more than 20 minutes for some stir fried bee hoon. The kitchen doesn't prioritize order sequence, but rather whichever dish is more popular.  Never buying from them again."
Hong Style Fried Rice,"I read the reviews after eating here and figured that the management listened to the feedback and made improvements all around. My family of 3 were there at 12pm on a Sunday afternoon, and we were seated immediately. In addition, throughout our lunch, I noticed that the tables turned around quite swiftly and there was hardly a line outside. The restaurant also had queue poles set up outside the restaurant to ensure some order. The ordering system is now digital via QR code, which makes ordering a breeze. Our food was prepared super quickly too! Everything we ordered was tasty, but the dry noodle option had so much sauce that it was like a soup. We only had a cup of Chinese tea and a canned drink, so we can't really comment on the other drinks on the menu. Overall, not a bad experience at all!"
Hong Style Fried Rice,Underwhelming Hong Kong cafe food. Milk tea was the only saving grace. The noodles lacked the springiness. Bolo Bun had an underwhelming crust. It wasn't even heated up! The French toast was over fried as the toast was soaked in oil.
Hong Style Fried Rice,"Nice place with good vibe and an extensive menu for Hong Kong cuisine. From main dish to dim sum, you can expect a variety of meat and staple items.  Dim sum was flavourful, and I particularly enjoyed the siew mai and rice roll. The price point is on the slightly high side, but the ambience made up for it. There is good space between seats, and the background music takes you back to the 80s. Overall, a nice place for your stomach."
Hong Style Fried Rice,"Was quite surprised to see such a low rating but because there's no queue at all we decided to try (Sunday 6pm).  The signature noodles and crispy bolo bun are not available.  The noodle: we order HK thin egg noodle, water spinach, pork chop, beef brisket, beef satay with HK marinade sauce. Price $10.30. When the bowl was ready, we were shocked at how many pieces of meat were given and that the meat were su chunky. The pork cutlet tastes clean and not fatty at all, the beef brisket is soft and tender, the beef satay is interesting. Overall it's nice. The sauce as a bit of herbal taste. It's not as salty as expected.  The burger: we order sorrowful romance bolo bun. It has bbq pork, sunny side up egg with runny yolk, a piece of lettuce. It's nice and simple. The pork bbq is quite thick. Price $6.80.  Drink: we order HK Style tea & coffee mixed. It doesn't come with sugar so we add sugar to our liking. The cup is quite big, maybe similar to big cup at Toast Box. Taste is normal, nothing special. Price $3.20.  Ambiance is nice if there's no queue, you can slowly eat although there are signs stating dining time limit 45 minutes. It's self service. We order using the QR code. The lousy thing about the website is that we can't change the component of the order  so when we wanted to change the content of the noodle, we had to delete existing bowl in the cart and create new bowl to add to the cart. You collect your food at the counter when your number is called. We didn't really know what our number was as it's not clear. It's the last 2 or 3 digits of your order ID."
Hong Style Fried Rice,"For tea lovers, you definitely must try their cold tea in the glass bottle.  The tea is very concentrated (gao) and is something unique to me.  As the stall name indicate, the cart noodles is their signature. Ever since I tried it, I keep coming back for more. There are so many combination to try.  Personally, I prefer the yellow noodle and the thin egg noodle which require additional top up. For the dishes, I would go for luncheon meat, chicken chop and pork chop for the maximum value. Otherwise I will go for chicken feet or chicken drumlet.  Besides the noodles, the pork polo bun is a must try. The meat is very thick and generous, just look at the cross section of the polo bun. Besides that, the an ran xiao hun bun (naming inspired by Stephen chow movie) is another must try as it provide a great blend of sweet and savouries through its combination of egg, char siew and polo bun."
Hong Style Fried Rice,Please listen to me. DO NOT order the baked rice EVER. I made this horrible mistake and purchased the chicken baked rice. It smells like a piece of overused wet rag and taste EXTREMELY blend. The cheese was barely there and the rice was rancid. The chicken was like a moist cardboard and the overall taste experience was THE WORST I ever had . This is not a hate comment i really enjoyed their curry but please in gods name DO NOT get the baked rice no matter what. Thanks
Hong Style Fried Rice,"Have eaten here several times. Do try the curry chicken ($6) and fried mee tai mak ($6). Above average! Curry is thick and fragrant, home cooked style. However, the chicken is a bit bland. The fried mee tai mak has wok hei and comes with two prawns and a few slices of fishcakes. If there are more ingredients and vegetables, it would be better. The belacan chilli is good. Service is not bad too."
Hong Style Fried Rice,"Bad. I paid $5 for a bowl of water, some salted vegetable and 3 pieces of unmarinated pork. I really cant tell how this bowl and the pic on their shop even looks the same. Shocking !!!"
Hong Style Fried Rice,
Hong Style Fried Rice,"Updated May 2023 Quite surprised that a shop with High standards has dipped .  Ordered the bee Tak mak set today n added on home made squid cake . I tried their chicken wings n other items before but was shocked how small the squid cake is , topped up $3 plus . Kindly don’t rip off your customers .  Jun/Jul 2022 Ordered for delivery the Gam Heong Bee Tai Mak with prawns spicy and fried rice with pork chop.  The pork chop was not too well marinated and tough .  The bee Tai Mak was awesome and among the most tasty and filled with wok hei, definitely a must order !!!  Prawn paste chicken wings was well seasoned  was fried till crispy."
Hong Style Fried Rice,"Very very very good fried rice, chilli and pork :face_savoring_food: Novena is quite far for me but I will come back just for this!  *Shoutout to Shinjin for recommending this"
Hong Style Fried Rice,Never fail to have my favorite Italian herb chicken fried rice when I am at Novena area. Piping hot wok hei aroma oozing out as you open the box. Generous thick chunk of chicken in it !  Keep up the good work Fried Rice SG !
Hong Style Fried Rice,"Overall a disappointment. Though the fried rice was fragrance but the rice were way too meshy, probably an off day for them but I can only rate what was served.  I also decided to add a squid cutlet to the fried rice instead of the usual chicken/pork cutlet but it was pathetically bite size yet cost much more than if ordering the chicken/pork cutlet fried rice combo.  2nd visit: A much improvement over the 1st visit, maybe cos I have it on site this time. Also only after the meal then I realised they actually have an indoor dining area which is hard to notice cos the kitchen is right in the middle between the indoor and outdoor seating."
Hong Style Fried Rice,Never failed in their quality of food. Still the best fried rice joint in Sg in my opinion.
Hong Style Fried Rice,"Ordered xo sauce noodles , tomato soup macaroni,egg tarts , sandwiches and curry fish ball . Overall food very nice . It's just that the xo sauce noodle's sauce could be less bitter. Staff are very friendly. Atmosphere wise the chair was a little old. Overall experience 9.5/10. Would definitely come back."
Hong Style Fried Rice,"Tried the egg tart and baked chicken pie which were recommended items on the menu. The egg tart was so-so - have definitely seen and tasted better. The crust of the chicken pie was yummy and slightly sweet, but when you delve into the filling you’ll see quite a bit of what looks like boiled chicken skin (which isn’t to my personal liking)."
Hong Style Fried Rice,"Nice little HK tea house cafe. A great selection of HK styled food. Really miss my trips to HK, so this is a good substitute Sampled their dry instant noodles with fried eggs and chicken chop Curry fish balls, fried luncheon meat, French toast with peanut butter, HK milk tea"
Hong Style Fried Rice,"The food was not bad, pretty decent. What sealed the deal was the toasted bread and the yuan yang! The two cheapest dishes we ordered but the most memorable! Mains can improve a little with both presentation and taste, but the portions were amazing! Delicious!"
Hong Style Fried Rice,"Im a huge huge fan of their polo bun!!! Definitely a must try if youre there!! I can eat like 10 of those in a day ngl its so good you cant stop. I think this place has the best hk 茶餐厅 food in sg!! Pretty much what you can get in hong Kong :smiling_face_with_heart-eyes: Im always leaving the place so satisfied, will be back for more!"
Hong Style Fried Rice,"A new favourite find for Hong Kong food! Milk tea was thick and rich, came unsweetened so feel free to add the packets of sugar provided. Peanut butter french toast was very crispy & eggy. Will be back again to try more items on the menu!"
Hong Style Fried Rice,"The milk tea is authentic, can taste the bitterness of tea and not too sweet. The instant noodle was just ordinary instant noodle that you can cook at home. The beef noodle a bit oily, but quite special taste due to the sauce, which I still managed to finish the whole plate. The Char Siew was super fatty and cholesterol level will likely increase after eating it, but still it’s at the yummy nice side due to the smooth scrambled egg. Their French toast, polo bun with butter, curry fishball with beef tripe were super duper yummy! I felt their side dish and bun are nicer than main course though. Wonderful place for tea break."
Hong Style Fried Rice,"Milk tea and french toast were pretty tasty and authentic. Tomato pork chop baked rice was tasty - sauce was not too sour, pork chop was tender enough. Satay beef noodles was decent, probably will not order again though. Scrambled eggs was good - thick and creamy. But everything was slightly pricier than other cha chaan tengs."
Hong Style Fried Rice,"The Cha Chan Ting sells a good selection of delicious HK food.  Visited with my wife and ordered scramble egg sandwich, curry pork chop rice and Swiss chicken wings.  The food is delicious especially the Swiss chicken wings. Came here a couple of time after work at about 9pm but only managed to try once as it closes at 8.30pm.  Will definitely return to try their other dishes."
Hong Style Fried Rice,Was lucky to get a table upon arrival. Food was served fast and we were lucky to get one egg tart each when they are out from the oven.  Tomato base sauce is a little more sour but still acceptable. Meat is tender and well marinated.  French Toast with peanut butter is interestingly different from the usual ones we eat at char chan teng as it should be one whole piece. But I do appreciate this one bite sized and dish is good to share with more friends. Milk tea taste really good and is good to reuse and recycle the bottles. I really like the scramble egg and luncheon meat bun. Keep up the good work!
Hong Style Fried Rice,Fresh fish chunk for the fish beehun! Taste good and price are reasonable. Waiting tine might be longer at peak hours like dinner.
Hong Style Fried Rice,"Your average Zi Char place, ordered Curry Pork rice. I like that the curry sauce used is thick and more on the spicier side."
Hong Style Fried Rice,Great food all round. XO fish soup is tasty and doesn't leave you thirsty after. Prawn paste chicken has probably the best fried skin I have tried. Prawn roll fritters are fantastic as well. Baby Kailan with garlic was very good too.
Hong Style Fried Rice,"Very bad service staff. The bad is very bad, very salty. Very expensive No worth going there to have dinner"
Hong Style Fried Rice,"XO fish head bee hoon (7/10) Generous amounts of thick fish slices and been hoon. Soup is flavourful with strong XO taste, chinese wine, and ginger. There are plenty of ginger slices too.  Do order this only if you have the time and patience to slowly debone and enjoy the fish. There were just too many bones from the fish being cut squarely.  Service was still rather slow even though we were the only customers at 9pm."
Brostern,"Their food is ok, butter rice is nice. Chicken cutlet reminds me of my secondary school fried chicken snack. The price increases a few times. I order online but they gave me wrong/missing order. If order at their stalls, the preparation could take sometimes, then sometimes they will closed their stalls to go smoking at the carpark."
Brostern,"Generous portions, delicious food, friendly staff! Western Ambeng idea was definitely a hit with the family as usually everyone is so fickle for iftar choices and they love the variety of sauces as well!"
Brostern,"One of the best Ayam Penyet I’ve had given the kick of the sambal & flavoursome of the rice! The chicken itself was crispy, and huge. I’m always ordering it via GrabFood, and given the 10-15mins delivery time, food was always served at its best quality. Never fails to disappoint. Other dishes like the Briyani and satay as well were delicious! Definitely something you should try given the price :heart_hands_light_skin_tone:"
Brostern,"Decided to check out the long queue that is consistent during peak hours. While cooking time may varies depending on what you order. There is a buzzer system and I will say it is worth the wait. Taste wise I got what I paid for. If there is one small niggle, the price is considered on the mid tier side considering it is inside ci yuan cc."
Brostern,"Take note that Brostern occupies two stalls - one that serves their more extensive menu and one that just focuses on fried chicken thigh + briyani/flavoured rice. Overall good spot for interesting Malay-Western fusion, but nothing too inventive. Fills you up."
Happy Pot,"I ordered Tonkutsu soup and I choose tang hoon and pork that cost me $5.50. Price is reasonable, but ingredients are little. Soup is flavourful but service can be improved as it’s the first time ordering and I was confused. There was no business yet the boss or the staff gave me an impression he was not willing to have me returning back. Because basic thank you or smile was not even acknowledged. Other vendors attitude is much better."
Happy Pot,"My wife and I were pleasantly surprised to stumble upon this stall selling personal hotpots and mookata for $5.50. Value for money because we’re both small eaters but you have the option of adding more ingredients and meat. Have not tried the other soups but we love the tonkotsu, it was flavourful and creamy!"
Happy Pot,"Ordered the BBQ chicken set. Food is OK, and considering the $5.50 price, it is very value for money.  Ordering was straightforward, but collecting the food was not ideal. There was no order number, and everyone had to crowd around a small opening besides the stall to wait for them to shout out the next dishes to be served."
Happy Pot,"My 1st and last time ordering from Happy Pot. Delivery was late by 45min. They did inform me for being late, due to heavy rain. But this is not a reason. It was delivered by car. The distance is only 20min away.  Lateness for 15 to 20 min is still acceptable.  But not 45min. Our lunchtime is only 1hr.  Food quality is 3/10. We ordered a mala Xiang gua and hotpot set. They pack hot and fresh food together in the same bag. This may cause food contamination.  Mala Xiang gua Taste is weak, the mushroom is still very hard and raw. Ended up we have to cook them again in our mala soup. The soup broth is watery and chilled. Therefore, it is not freshly cooked. The tomato taste is weak, mala taste is still ok (maybe we use the mala Xiang gua mushroom to cook in the soup), good that it is not oily. Herbal soup is too bitter.  Most of the items were still in frozen conditions. They use frozen veg and mushroom. We had no time to thew and wash the veg, so they are a total waste for us. The pork belly colour is very pale, look like it had been kept in the freezer for very long and there was a bad smell. The fish used were dory fish. Prawn freshness is still ok. Hotdog, prawn paste and scallop were good. Chilli sauce $0.50 per tub is acceptable. It is not very suitable for hotpot. But good for the hotplate.  Price point, I can get better soup broth and quality elsewhere. Dislike the frozen veg and mushroom. The advantage of Happy pot is that they have free delivery and they give free pot when u spend $80. The free pot can't be used again, because we do not have the special fuel tub with open fire. It may not be kids friendly.  But lateness and poor quality of food is not acceptable.  I'm willing to pay for a on-time delivery and quality food."
Happy Pot,"BBQ plate with chicken was terrible. Not sure of other dishes.  Was served un-seasoned chicken strips, 1 hotdog, mushroom, and luncheon meat. no BBQ sauce provided on the side either. no salt no pepper.  I think this dish has no difference between buying from grocery store, going home and cooking your food in your pan and eating from it. oh there is one difference, salt.  got rice on the side, it tasted cold and stale like refrigerated rice."
The Voice,An amazing music learning experience in which the vocal teachers all help the students grow in their own specialized unique way!

The Voice,"Carina is a very professional coach who is able to immediately identify and develop a customised program. By focusing on my shortfalls, we were able to see a vast improvement mid-way through the entire training program. Upon completion of the training program, I have sharpened my presentation skills and can definitely see this as a boost to my career."
The Voice,It was a wonderful experience for me and I look forward to my lessons with Ms. Carina. Her lessons are infused with her passion and positive energy! Thank you very much Carina for everything you have taught me!
The Voice,"Carina is a very professional coach, she was able to identify my weakness and help me to solve the issue on the date of the session. Very effective improvement."
The Voice,"Carina provided clear, comprehensive feedback on my presentation skills that helped me to understand where I was lacking, and gave clear, simple steps on how to improve.  Not only was Carina good with technical details, she added extra value through her steps to improve my mindset and change my attitude towards presentations. Her warm personality also makes every session enjoyable. Thank you!"
The Voice,"5 Star Training Experience. Well-worth. Coach Carina is very sharp in pointing out my mis-pronunciations and do targeted exercises. She is also good at teaching how to project your vioce out using 丹田 and effectively exercising your diaphragm. In short, her one-for-one training is very useful for a Chinese English speaker like me. I would like to recommend Carina to anyone who wants to polish their English speaking to the next level."
The Voice,"Searching to improve on my speech after being rejected for an interview for my dream job, I stumbled upon Be The Voice. From the first lesson, Brain’s enthusiasm and warmth made me feel at ease. The lessons I’ve subsequently had with him, have definitely improved my speech. It gave me the added confidence to speak more during meetings / social gatherings. With this, I had the opportunity to interview for my dream job at a company I’ve always wanted to work for since I was a kid. As I’m typing this, I’m happy to say I got accepted into the job. Not only did I achieve what I wanted, I also made a friend in Brian. Thank you Brian!"
The Voice,"I’m really happy with my decision to pick up this course, which goes way beyond what the usual public speaking courses offer. Brian was able to pinpoint the exact areas I need to improve on to be a better communicator. I truly believe I wouldn’t have picked these out without him. He’s also really fun to work with!  So if you take up this course, you’ll be getting really customized (not run-of-the-mill-free-on-YouTube-type) advice, and there’ll lots of laughs along the way.  Thanks Brian! I’ll try to remember everything you taught me! :)"
The Voice,"It is one of the best investment I made for the year. It created awareness in the way I speak and produce my voice.  Speaking is something we do everyday, and with awareness, practice and change, I can say that it will be life-changing.  Bryan is truly a master in his craft."
The Voice,"Brian is a very experienced coach for voice training.  Even though the sessions are conducted via zoom, he was able to engage me and I learnt a great deal from him.  A to-go person if you wish to improve on your presentation and speaking skills."
The Voice,"I signed up for the full course under Brian(trainer). Brian was really good. The courses are structured and paced for a working adult. He focused each session on selected materials.  I had attended a few others, but by far Brian courses and materials helped me to understand communication is not just about the message, but its about the way we say it for a story(articulation, intonation, context, and emotion).  Brian materials and classes are easy to follow, focused in voice articulation with context.  If you want to improve presentation skill, change from a boring voice to a story teller, you need to come here and look for Brian. !  I will definitely come back and look forward to his classes again!."
The Voice,"I have a story to share.  I met a lady years ago who firmly believes she cannot sing because she has a dead tone voice.  She feels who hears her speaking on the phone will think she is unfriendly. I do not believe what this lady has said; I know she has a heart of passion.  How do I make her believe in herself?  I then come across The Vocal Studio; I encourage this lady to visit this studio; perhaps she will find the angel that sees her differently.  More than half a year ago, she took a brave step and met Coach Hanna Ma, and the rest is history.  Coach Hanna is an excellent teacher.  She sees every student as an opportunity to grow, to groom, to believe in yourself. Therefore, she does not ONLY teach you SINGING, and she teaches you to accept yourself, see your strength, and believe in YOURSELF.  I see the lady transform on July 10, 2021, at The Vocal Studio Small Circle Performance Day.  She sang Iris, Goo Goo Doll.  The audience gave her the warmest clap.  She felt her throat has tightened; she saw Coach Hanna nod her head and said well done.  Anyone who wants to sing, thinking if they can sing, can singing change the way I speak, will singing improve my presentation skills? Look no further; The Vocal Studio will change your perception.  Coach Hanna and the coaches will change your LIFE."
The Voice,"Did not know what to expect when I first came to the Vocal Studio for the lesson. However over the next few months, i became more engaged in singing, as coach Hanna taught me various songs, and helped me with my pitch accuracy. Will definitely recommend this place as it will inspire you and you will have a fun and enjoyable time there."
The Voice,I had the opportunity to learn casual singing with Hanna as a group and as individual... Hanna is a very sharp and sensitive teacher ... very positive and encouraging ... I have been a professional teacher trainer for more than 20 years ... I know a good one when I experience one ... and Hanna is one of the few ... awesome job !

The Voice,"Was extremely disappointed with our dinner visit here. Food were not served hot but warm instead.  We ordered 3 items and they were served in small bowls. Just look at the Braised Pork Rice, you will definitely know how was our feeling. The portion was pretty small, and not only that the braised pork looked kinda dried too.  Oyster Mee Sua and Pig Intestines Mee Sua were served in a slightly warm temperature. Mee Sua was not flavourful enough, very normal taste. Doesn't even taste any similar as in Taiwan. Moreover, the oyster were not fully cleaned, there are shells found in it. As for pig intestines, it tasted not bad though.  It's a No No for us~"
The Voice,"Having M1 Braised pork rice as lunch here. The pork belly is tender with fragrant pork smell. After mixing all, it is bit salty but the sour preserved vegetables soup with goji dilute the salty flavour. Overall is not bad. Could be one of your lunch choice at work when you're wondering what to have or you miss Taiwanese cuisine."
The Voice,"Had a late lunch and avoided the lunch crowd. Ordered the oyster mee sua and chicken cutlet. Mee Sua was not too thick but rich in flavour. The cutlet breading was a crispy contrast to the chicken skin and complemented the flavourful chicken. The spice level was just right, pronounced flavours but not overwhelming. Will come back again if in the area."
The Voice,"M4, the most popular rice bento was very flavorful and nicely blend taste. Chicken cullet tender and tasty."
The Voice,"Went in with high hopes after reading the eatbook review, wasn't worth the trek out there. The lu rou fan needs a lot of work - seems like they just cut a pork belly into small strips and stew it for a while resulting in a mix of fat and very hard meat bits. Nothing like the TW version.  The Mee Sua is as the review mentioned, a bit on the bland side. Got the extra oysters for +$2, they could have been fresher.  Braised pork belly bun was decent - again, they need to trim up their meat otherwise you'll get soft bone and harder meat bits in with the soft belly parts. Could have used a bit of coriander/greens and peanut powder like the TW version.  Chili was good but that's not the point. Hope they can improve the flavors."
The Voice,"Romeo is a very underrated teacher. I don't think the amount of reviews here equate to how good he is. I attended his lessons and he explains the concepts clearly which is very important to know as a vocal student too. Besides that, he has good hearing, observations skills and techniques that he teaches. I'll be coming back again :)"
The Voice,"Romeo's manages to explain the technical concepts in singing very clearly and specifically, and my voice has grown incredibly from his instruction :smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes: I never thought my singing voice could be beautiful, but training with him has helped me to understand & appreciate it. It has helped to restore my confidence as well :smiling_face_with_hearts: Thank you!"
The Voice,"I started taking voice lessons from Romeo a few months ago over knowing that an ex-colleague who played in a band took lessons from him and highly recommended Voice Whisperer. He told me that Romeo had helped him improve his vocal range and quality of singing a lot.  After a few months of lessons, while I am still not great at singing, my husband went from needing to cover his ears to telling me I sound much better now, so it's a win in my books. haha. I look forwarder to improving further with Romeo's help! :)"
The Voice,"I have worked with Romeo for more than 3 years, and it has been a pleasurable learning journey. Romeo is very passionate in teaching and he has helped a lot in searching for my own voice. I am definitely more confident in singing and the use of my voice. I would highly recommend Voice Whisperer!"
The Voice,"Would give Romeo 100 stars if I could! Having gone for weekly lessons for almost 4 months now, I've seen major improvements in my voice and singing. Romeo teaches super helpful techniques and skills that helps me to discover my voice in a safe and fun manner. One of the best vocal coaches I've had:) Would totally recommend to anyone looking for a vocal coach!"
The Voice,"Previously had the Braised Pork Bento with chicken cutlet. The braised pork was quite good but didn't like the chicken cutlet, so try out the same BPB with pork ribs instead and this was worst!  The ribs was what it seems, very bony and even its little meat doesn't peel off from the bone easily, I guess only people who enjoy munching fish head would enjoy it."
The Voice,"Ordered the 9.90 set. Which consists of braised pork rice, mee sua, and popcorn chicken  The good thing is that the braised pork sauce drenched the rice all till the bottom. The bad thing is that the sauce was too watery and lacking in flavor. The topping amount also was miniscule. Not much meat / veges.  The mee sua was very oily and tasted very simple. There was no meat or even any ingredients for the mee sua.  The popcorn chicken is the more edible choice in this set. And despite so, it was more skin / flour than meat.  Overall a big disappointment. Taste wise below average. Price wise quite expensive for the amount and ingredients included. A far cry from shihlin or even 8 度空间。"
Green Chilli Chicken Rice,"This is top notch quality chicken rice. I have come here numerous times but it was either closed or the queue was so long during lunch. It is so worth the wait despite some queue. The whole dish is so robust in the taste - superb quality basmati rice, crispy tender and hot chicken drumstick, and very special green and red chilli. It is so memorable that I will keep going back for this."
Green Chilli Chicken Rice,"This is definitely also one for the spicy-intolerance as the green chillies despite looking heavily coated on the chicken were devoid of any spiciness that they actually even included red chillies on the side.  Everything here were mildly done. The rice mildly flavoured, chicken mildly fried but in a good way as the juiciness of the meat were fully intact. The green chilli were more like a radish than chilli. Though not a must have dish to me but definitely prefer this than Ayam Penyat any given day."
Green Chilli Chicken Rice,"Finally managed to get a taste of it again after missing it sometime as it is always very long queue during lunchtime and on weekend, it even longer. Today the plate of green chilli chicken rice taste exceptionally good. The basmati rice is nicely done. The chicken is really tender. Even if you don't take spicy, u still can give it a try. It pretty mild spicy with a taste of sweetness. :thumbs_up:"
Green Chilli Chicken Rice,"A friend of mine told me about this unusual style of Chicken Rice at Sims. As always, I am pretty adventurous when it comes to good food. I drove from the West to the East just to savour this GREEN CHILLI CHICKEN RICE. It didn't disappoint. The stall served basmati rice, which was flavourful, and not oily. What gave us the kick to this plate of chicken rice was the chilli - two types to be exact, red and green. Both chillis had a different taste complex, the red one was spicier, but the green one (particularly fried with shallots) had a lovely aftertaste. I enjoyed it. The chicken drumstick was equally as satisfying. Perfectly grilled and the chef flattened the chicken (to soften the meat) before serving it out. It was juicy and marinated well.  One KEY THING TO NOTE, the store opens at 10.30 am and closes at 1.30 pm or while stock last.  Damage - $6 per plate Would I come back - Most definitely, but not to travel from West to East. As long as I am within the area, I will go for it."
Green Chilli Chicken Rice,"Food was amazing - The chicken was moist yet had such crispy skin, the rice was plain but it paired well with the green chilli and red (sambal- like?) chilli and the soup cooked with star anise was 10/10! Waited about 5 minutes to get my food served but was the second to last person before they sold out for the day (was there at 12:45) so would recommend going early :)"
Garang Grill Express,"Not a lot of ppl on weekday evening. I like the pasta dish. The tomato sauce is not salty in my opinion. The crispy chicken chop is good. Love the coleslaw. And it is served piping hot. So if you like your dish piping hot, then this is one of your option.. price wise is consider decent for me."
Garang Grill Express,"Created by the New Ubin Seafood Group, Garang Grill shuttered its last stall in 2022. Opened in March 2023, Garang Grill Express takes a step away from its older brother, specialising in Western fare closer to what you find in neighbourhood coffee shops.  [What it's good for] • It's not an ideal date-night spot, but it's a great spot for no-frills Western meals at a decent price. • The sides are decently satisfying with large portions accompanying the meats. • Just the right amount of firmness and tenderness, the black-pepper chicken chop (S$11.50) was well-marinated and full of flavour. • For something more luxurious, the lamb chop (S$21.90) had a rich and complex taste. • Despite its plain appearance, the smoked pork and mushroom pasta (S$14) was scrumptious with umami-laden button mushrooms and smoky pork. • The buah keluak smoked burger (S$17.50) is a bit of an acquired taste. But if you're a fan of that nutty, earthy and slightly bitter flavour you'd get at a good Peranakan restaurant, you'd enjoy this. • A (possibly) healthier option is the guacamole and lime smoked burger (S$17.50). It adds a southwestern citrus twist to the classic cheeseburger. • Garang Grill Express's half spring chicken with fries and coleslaw (S$10.90) has a crisp skin, with juicy and tender flesh.  [What it could improve on] • The accompanying fries are on the bland side and could do with extra seasoning and a double fry. • It has limited drink options with only canned drinks for thirsty diners. • The interior is rather bare-bones.  [Our quick takes] Is it conducive to conversation? — Yes, the tables are nicely spaced out. Is a reservation necessary? — Walk-ins only! How to get there? — Head to the second floor of City Gate, a three-minute walk from Exit A of Nicoll Highway MRT station.  Read more at HungryGoWhere."
Garang Grill Express,"Our first time and it’s pretty cool and nice food We tried their sirloin steak, chicken chop and lamb chops and its pretty value and also each main comes with 2 sides so we had 6 sides The crispy chicken wings afforded a yummy taste Tucked neatly on the second floor of Citigate, we recommend diners to come here for a nice family outing with friends and relatives Recommend Score : 8/10"
Garang Grill Express,Berempah Chicken Burger is exceptionally good. Uniquely seasoned with lemongrass. Love it!
Garang Grill Express,"Food is good, but there is no sign of it saying if the store is open or not. The atmosphere a bit not welcoming it's dark but the staff is friendly."
Basilico,"Have not been here for quite awhile, so went for their Thursday steak buffet. Still as good with all the appetizers and pizzas. The steak is soft and juicy but pity the tomahawk is a bit dry. Roast lamb is great as well. Didn’t really ate too much of the pasta though its very good cos need to save space for cheese and desserts!"
Basilico,"Fantastic brunch!!! Definitely recommend the add on of free flow alcohol. The highlight is the cheese room … over 40 different kinds of Italian cheese! It’s amazing. Pasta is great, the seafood statin is great. Loved the dessert selection. 100% a hit with everyone. Highly recommend!"
Basilico,Good spread of food. Service was great too. The lasagna stood out. Their custom pasta (due to dietary restrictions) was really good. They even had a cheese room!
Basilico,Came for restaurant week 2021. Amazing food for its price! Dessert platter had a wide variety. Salad had many elements to it too. Yum!
Basilico,"The produce served at the restaurant was terrific and fresh! Enjoyed the tomatoes flown in from Italy very much, really sweet and juicy! The food selection was sufficient and most of it tasted brilliant. The service staff were also very helpful, the chef gave his inputs about the cheeses, water was constantly refilled in time. Our table was a bit too close to the next one, but that’s alright."
Smile Dessert,"The waffles are filling and not too sweet! A lot of choices in their drinks/menu. There’s a play area for kids and adults(kid at heart). You can dine as long as you want. The server won’t chase you out. If you dine at 2nd/3rd floor, there’s a monitor there where u can see your que number."
Smile Dessert,"Please arrange the cashier who able to talk properly or better communication. I don’t know why the staff don’t want to speak, we checked with her whether is self collection or wait for the number being call, she just look at us innocently and walk away, then the other staff helped her to answer after we repeated for 3-4times. No offense, just wondering why"
Smile Dessert,"The location is near Bugis street area of ​​shophouses that sell food. The outlet is pink and often have people in line so it's easy to find.  The outlet turns out to be quite large with top floor have full seating area which is instagrammable and has a decoration like a ball pool area. Just some table with small capacity.  Meanwhile, on the lower floor, there is a semi-outdoor seating area on the sidewalk, of course, with a small table capacity. Near the cashier area there are several tables with a capacity of 4 people.  My order: * Mochi snow ice Topped with small mochi, the chewiness is just right & not sticky. Vanilla ice cream also added, the shaved ice is plain milk flavor & there is soy powder as a sprinkle.  Staff quite friendly & helpful. Service is also relatively fast, our order number will be called when the order is ready."
Smile Dessert,"First time going into the shop and the cashier was digging her nose without wearing her mask, the fork and tissue was stained by the ice cream, I went to questioned the staff and stared at me, he did not take any othet action e.g apologized or to replace a new bowl of bingsu. I was so angry with him. I will not recommend my friends to go again."
Smile Dessert,"If you’re looking to go here with a kid, be willing to have hawk eyes on them. Not a kid friendly place at all. Extremely sharp edges everywhere and tidiness is zero! No one speaks English, which is a problem too. Probably one of the most horrible places we’ve been to in Singapore."
Smile Dessert,Fun and interesting experience here for the family! There’s a dine in ball pit area which the kids really loved! Lots of different dessert choices to suit everyone! Souffle pancakes are our favourite!!
Smile Dessert,"The only smiles had in this establishment were at the expense of the food we were served. The bingsu came half-melted, although not clear from the photo, it arrived already immersed in its own liquid. The inside was filled with halved peanuts, this did not complement the dessert in any way, it was strange and jarring.  IMO bingsu should be soft, pillowy, milky, cold, but what we got was wet, semi-crunchy peanuts mixed with watery, clumpy, icey bingsu.  The mango-ice-rice ball was yummy, would recco!  The chocolate souffle was nice, but took a long time to come. 20-30 mins even though we were the only customers there. And the icecream it came with was quite melted, you can kind of see it in the photo, too. The cone wafer, my goodnesss, was so soggy! And the pointed part of it was wet, decided not to take a gamble on it.  The souffle came with a seemingly misplaced slice of orange (??). We had it with the souffle and would not recommend.  The cherry on top of this horrendous melted-bingsu is the warm-ness of the place. Although seated inside, the airconditioner was clearly on its last legs. Either way, the only way I'll come here again is after a massive bender at prinsep that completely wipes out all faculties relating to rationality.  2 stars for the nice mango and okay drink."
Smile Dessert,"Matcha yoghurt cubes tasted very unpleasant. Doesn't taste like matcha at all and was a weird combi with mango, as if there was fridge taste. Takes the smile away from you."
Smile Dessert,Quiet with a few tables of patrons at about 9pm. Ball pit was a fun touch for diners. The mango bingsu was packed with mango slices but the shaved ice itself was so-so. The souffle was a bit of a disappointment for me as I found it not as fluffy as expected. The staff was friendly and helpful. My company had a great time there!

Smile Dessert,Always love the funny and sweet vibe of Smile Dessert. Children are elated to eat at the balls pool. I just wonder how they clean the balls. Had the thai shaved ice. Very delicious.
Smile Dessert,"Chanced upon this dessert shop at Funan which served drinks, cakes and bingsu!  Was quite surprised by the texture of the bingsu -  very light and soft.  I thought it’d be too much but since it’s pretty light, 2 people can finish it without any issues.  I also love how they include rice crispies and chocolate shaves to “surprise” us.  A good spot for parents to bring their kids as there’s a ball pit here!"
Smile Dessert,"Here are what we tried at Smile Dessert.  :ice_cream: Cutie Bingsu Choice of coconut or yogurt flavour selection. We had the yogurt flavour that refresh our tastebud with a sour note. You get a variety of flavours within the bingsu itself as it was topped with a vanilla icecream with chocolate and nut coating, and hidden surprise of red pearls that burst into strawberry juice in your mouth.  :pancakes: Honey Souffle Love these jiggly wiggly souffle pancake. Fluffy and airy, it almost feel like biting into the cloud when you are eating them. They are so good on its own, yet the strawberries, whip cream and honey elevate the flavours into another level.  :shortcake: Classic Tiramisu Sweet mascarpone cream and soft lady fingers sponge, for people who love tiramisu, this is going to be your go to dish.  Besides their wide variety of desserts available, they also have a aesthetically pleasing ball pit to have for your instagram worthy shot."
Smile Dessert,"Aesthetically beautiful and cool, like having desserts in space! Very instagrammable!  I like the idea of having a pool of plastic balls, in a silver theme cafe, very chill and great place to hangout with children, friends or family.  *Cutie Bingsu Yoghurt $14.90 *Taro Tiramisu $12.90 *Honey Souffle $19.90  I like it that it's less sweet and the texture is really soft and flavourful.:thumbs_up_light_skin_tone:"
Smile Dessert,"Went on a weekday afternoon, it wasn't crowded. We ordered the cute coconut bingsu, it was a delightful treat! Instagrammable dessert cafe with a ball pit area. Weekday promo available too."
Kelim Dakdoritang,"Authentic Korean food! Korean waiter entertained us haha. Do go for their signature spicy chicken stew. Packed with flavour due to the garlic. Fried gizzard was awesome too. However, somehow there’s an irritation to our eyes when we were eating. Maybe it’s the ventilation or garlic?"
Kelim Dakdoritang,Yesterday I met an oppa and he told me the Korean's secret to looking youthful and a  healthier body! It's in their garlic and chicken soup!  The ingredients they use are so fresh and I really love their hospitality!  Will definitely visit again!
Kelim Dakdoritang,"I agree completely with the previous reviewer; we must have visited on the same evening. I believe that all of us in the queue were willing, and happy, to wait if it was a fair and transparent system. But if you really have to host your friends, and they started appearing from 7pm, you should have informed us at that time that you would not be able to seat us instead of making us continue to wait and for the queue to get longer. Please understand that your friends are important, but so are your customers. The way you handled this shows a complete lack of customer service orientation."
Kelim Dakdoritang,New korean food concept. Soup was nothing like the usual army stew. Couldn’t describe the taste but must try! Heavenly!!
Kelim Dakdoritang,Service was prompt and the staff were very polite. Food made me feel like I was back in Korea:face_savoring_food:  Best to make reservation for quick seating! Highly recommended!
Porcelain Cafe,Sessions have been great with Doris who consistently shares which procedure will be next and also checks in if the treatment eg pressure or temperature is comfortable. Both the sun rescue and clear purity sensitive treatments are really relaxing and painless with visible results.
Porcelain Cafe,"My first time at Porcelain Origin and it was such a fabulous, relaxing experience! I opted for the ClearPurity Sensitive and Madeleine was my aesthetician! She was very clear in each step of the facial process, and the treatment itself was gentle but effective - quite a welcomed change from the facials I’ve been to at different places where the extraction/chemicals used were harsh.  Porcelain Origins was also very clean and calming. Would absolutely recommend it."
Porcelain Cafe,"Had been with Porcelain for a few years now. During this time, I have changed a few therapists but all of which are equally skilled. My current therapist is Stella. She is attentive to my sensitive skin condition and would make necessary adjustment and recommendation to the treatment for me. Her quintessential facial extraction skills is also good and level of pain is very bearable."
Porcelain Cafe,First visit to Porcelain was no short of exceptional! Both the consultant and Therapist were knowledgeable and made recommendations based on my skin condition for the day. The facial session was really comfortable and my therapist made sure to use products that suit the needs of my skin during the session. Will definitely be back for more!
Porcelain Cafe,"I have been doing my facial treatments with Emily at Porcelain for a long time.  She’s the best beautician you can ever asked for!  Emily is very friendly and attentive, she really understands what is the most suitable treatment for her customers. My skin is always radiant and smooth after each treatment. Thank you Emily for taking such a great care of me :slightly_smiling_face:"
Porcelain Cafe,"During a recent visit to Singapore with my partner, Raquel, we had breakfast at Perkatory Coffee Bar. The food and coffee were both amazing and the customer service was great. Thank-you for the great service. Highly recommended."
Porcelain Cafe,"Popped by for a little break in between shopping, there was only one person tending to the stall; she didn’t notice when my friend and I were waiting to be seated until after quite a while. Also, we wanted to just walk in and sit down but the tables were not cleared. There wasn’t a proper menu available so we had to either view the menu at the entrance of the cafe (which had pictures) or the one behind the counter (without pictures).  Ambience is cosy; I think it’s basically a waiting area also for those who have facial appointments with Porcelain.  Ordered the Starry Galaxy Art Bowl ($24) which comes with a pot of tea; visually appealing but taste-wise was average. Would pop by here for tea if I need a place to chill and get comfortable, but maybe not for their acai bowls."
Porcelain Cafe,"Plant based cafe serving healthy vegan desserts such as acai bowl, smoothie, cookies, ice cream, coffee, and more. Ambience is posh.  They serve unique smoothie art bowls, which are the most Instagramable desserts I have ever seen, and the first-of-its-kind in Singapore. There are 3 smoothie bowl themes this holiday namely Beach Paradise, Unicorn Dreams and Starry Galaxy each featuring a type of superfood in its natural and freshly blended smoothie bowl.  Check out my Unicorn Dreams seen here.  Their desserts are healthy and delicious. I also highly recommend their smoothies which use frozen fruits without ice and the result is a thick, creamy, full-flavoured drink."
Porcelain Cafe,"Had their vegan chocolate high tea today (11am, Tuesday). Tried to WhatsApp the cafe staff before going down (to check on promotions/discounts) but they didn't respond. Only one server but he was prompt in preparing the food and tea. He was very helpful in helping us take group photos, made the effort to ensure our pictures look good! Acai bowl was nice but rest of the desserts were alright, not spectacular. Thankfully the food was generally filling. Tea was refillable. Generally pleasant and quiet place to chill on a weekday morning."
Porcelain Cafe,"Don't go if you don't have a lot of time on your hands! Waited 49 minutes for a basic açai bowl, even though the place wasn't even that busy (went Saturday around noon). I shudder to think about the waiting times during rush hour!  Decor/ambiance is nice and the açai bowls actually pretty good. But I can't recommend unless they dramatically speed up their service."
Porcelain Cafe,"Escargot escargot was really good as well as the chocolate eclair; but imho, a cafe is not a cafe without an espresso based hot coffee. a bit dismayed to only find cold bottled flat white. It’s situated in tiny nook on the 4th floor that shares space with a beauty facial spa which took me a while to locate. I think it would’ve been better to have this as a neighbourhood cafe with a view than inside Paragon. The ambiance doesn’t do justice to its good pastries."
Porcelain Cafe,"We purchased a bottled cold chocolate drink here for $8.50. After we left the mall, we realized that the label said it was best consumed within 7 days of production, and the date of production was 31/8 on the label. We bought this on 9/9 so it was 2 days out of date. We immediately went back to return it to the store but did not receive any sincere apology for the expired product. 1 star because this drink is actually good."
Porcelain Cafe,The afternoon tea set was close to terrible. Ambience was super weird as it is shared with a facial place. Tea was overly diluted. Sweets had very weird tasting combinations that were not even good. Highly not recommended.
Porcelain Cafe,"Love the high tea set here, there’s some pastries available too"
Porcelain Cafe,Love the high tea!
Chef Wei HK Cheong Fun,The Chee Cheong Fun is great! Especially the prawn one that cost $5.00 where you will get about 8 prawn with the CCF~!! Try the Prawn Chee Cheong Fun with their Chili paste is wonderful! Great match (to me~).
Chef Wei HK Cheong Fun,"At the start of their expansion, Chef Wei was a definite go-to for chee cheong fun.  However the novelty has seemed to die down, or perhaps its the lack of consistency amongst stalls, or maybe for me it's just not worth it to queue for an overpriced CCF which quality can be matched at other CCF speciality/dim sum shops.  For over $5 a plate, it truly isn't value for money. Presentation and portion sizes are not justifiable for the price, and the wait doesn't contribute positively to its cause. Its true that their rice rolls are(or were) silky, but recent reviews seem to suggest a dip in quality and consistency.  I would go to my favourite dim sum shop and get equally good CCF in an air conditioned setting for the same price and with more selection, so I see no reason to need to patronise any of this establishments stalls anytime soon.  @goodfoodwrite - instagram & YouTube"
Chef Wei HK Cheong Fun,"With the renovated coffeeshop, it has brighten up the atmosphere. The chee cheong fun was delicious. They didn't scrimp on the sauce provided like other places."
Chef Wei HK Cheong Fun,I've tried it once a few months back and it was silky smooth with a very thin layer.  Today's prawn Chee Cheong Fun was a bit too thick and the prawns were a tad too rubbery for me. Would appreciate more consistency
Chef Wei HK Cheong Fun,Update Nov 2022: standard dropped!! CCF is now much thicker instead of silky smooth… dropping rating to 4*  Oct 2022: QQ charsiew Cheong fun at $4. Yummy!! Will re-order :)
Chef Wei HK Cheong Fun,"Price is fairly acceptable but taste is average, was expecting better. Best of all, received the wrong item for the first time visiting the store while there wasn’t any queue after lunch hours. It’s my bad to have not checked my custard buns became char siew buns. :loudly_crying_face: I’m curious how they got my orders wrong."
Chef Wei HK Cheong Fun,Fresh and hot. Value for money. Good quality. No need to go to the fancy/expensive dim sum in the malls. Hope it's not just for the beginning. Would be nice if have Cantonese congee!!
Chef Wei HK Cheong Fun,"Been a strong supporter of this stall since open. Every now and then, when pass by here will sure order their prawn cheong fun. The skin is nice and prawn was big crunchy and juicy. However, recently standard seem to drop. The skin still same, but the prawn has reduce in size, and dry. The previous time i came, it had a sour taste also. Had feedback to the stall assistant. He offer to make me a new one but i kindly declined. Had feedback to their fb page message also, but no reply. Will have to consider whether eat this again when pass by next time. Maybe will give chance to eat other outlet to see if got any difference."
Chef Wei HK Cheong Fun,"Queue wasn't long but the waiting time was. Tried the 1st time round in Bedok now decided to visit again in Ang Mo Kio. The taste between the 2 branches were pretty similar, the Cheong Fun was thin and smooth. Ordered the prawn one and the mushroom one. I've always liked the prawn one this was the 1st time eating the mushroom one and I have to say now mushroom will be my most favourite. Can actually feel that the mushroom Cheong Fun tastes more savoury and flavourful and the chewyness of the mushroom bits. I have to say the chili as always is a star complement which is restaurant grade and really makes the dish more enjoyable. A tad on the expensive side but still overall delicious and highly recommended."
Chef Wei HK Cheong Fun,"Nice place in a loc coffeeshop to get hongkong style chee cheong fun. Service was a littlw slow, had to wait around 10 minutes despite only 1 person ahead of me. Ordered a takeaway and had it only about 3 hours later.  Taste was still very good despite not eating it immediately. The sauce was a very nice balanced one, not too salty. i bought the prawn and zha leong version. Sauce was given in seperate containers. Would come back again if there isnt a queue"
Chef Wei HK Cheong Fun,"I knew I had to try this stall when I saw they only had Chee Cheong Fun and some side dishes. Yeah, the Chee Cheong Fun was chewy and packed with ingredients. Additionally, there's a wide selection of fillings. You should also try the chicken feet, which were juicy and plump, and the carrot cake, which was nicely fried. It's a little pricey, but understandable since it's a specialized stall."
Chef Wei HK Cheong Fun,"Honestly the best cheong fun I've ever had :exploding_head: it was incredibly silky soft and I noticed that the chef steamed it traditionally by lining a tray with a wet cotton steaming cloth. Highly recommend this place before catching your flight! Doesn't seem to be a location in the terminal 3 Changi airport but there's definitely a place there!  For more food reviews, check out my instagram @asydneysider :smiling_face_with_open_hands:"
Chef Wei HK Cheong Fun,A decent plate of prawn chee cheong fun. CCF was towards a thicker side but I’m ok with it. Taste pretty much like most of the other CCF. Not the best but ok to satisfy your craving if you want a nearby CCF~
Chef Wei HK Cheong Fun,"The Mushroom Cheong fun is so good. The skin is definitely not thick. It’s translucent and very tender. Any thinner and it won’t hold the generous ingredients inside. As for their dim sum, I’d skip the char siew bun. The carrot cake is not soft, over fried and the edges are hardened from re-frying. Not fresh. The siew mai was decent. The lor mai gai was ok too I’ll pass as well. Cheong fun shiok, but the rest not so."
Chef Wei HK Cheong Fun,We had our late lunch here. The Cheong fun was nice. I love the Teochew beef flavour as it is quite difficult to have in SG. But the soy sauce is too sweet for a Cantonese. Price was reasonable. One :star: from my hubby. He said it is the best Cheong Fun in Singapore. :thinking_face:
Chef Wei HK Cheong Fun,Had the beef cheong fun. The filling inside is the similar to the steamed beef balls at dim sum restaurant. the cheong fun texture is smooth. the sauce could be a little bit better. Overall still an excellent plate of cheong fun :)
Chef Wei HK Cheong Fun,Very nice hand made Cheong fan. The char Siew Bao and yam cake too! Price is a bit high though… waiting time 5-10 mins
Chef Wei HK Cheong Fun,"Love their CCF, it's a 4.5 for me. With their other stuff, overall comes down to 4 stars.  I come here occasionally for breakfast. But today, it's 8.25am on 25 Apr. Only one guy, and he tells me it's not ready yet. Have to wait till 8.40. They're supposed to be open at 7am. Drops down to 3 stars.  Also, their Lava Custard Buns are hit and miss. Sometimes they serve it before the custard melts, and you end up biting into paste rather than lava custard. Drops to 2 stars.  There are signs their standard is dropping. Hope they're able to do something about it.  Update 7 May. Ordered their Lava Custard Buns again. Photo attached."
Chef Wei HK Cheong Fun,"Greedy me decided to order 2 plates of Cheong Fun, char siew and prawn. Got my queue number and took a seat. Food was ready in about 5 minutes cause I was the only one :grinning_face_with_big_eyes:, probably because it was 2pm. Else the wait can be as long as 15-30 mins during peak period especially breakfast time. The Cheong fun is steamed and rolled on the spot, so fresh right! Love the texture, silky smooth with abundance of ingredients stuffed in each portion with a fragrant and tasty sauce accompanying it. Char siew is sweet and soft. The prawns are really fresh and there is a prawn in each spoonful of Cheong fun. Their sambal chili also happening. Abit spicy and you can taste the grounded dried prawns. There are about 4 variants available: plain, mushroom, char siew and prawn. Prices ranging from $3.00 to $5.00. I think it’s decent comparing to the portion and freshness.  Super highly recommended!!"
Chef Wei HK Cheong Fun,"Freshly made! Damn good as well!  EDIT: The young guy was better when I came, the new guy is more or less a 3/5 standard. Taste is almost the same but I miss what I tasted months ago  EDIT: Don’t order the dim sum, it’s horrible"
Chef Wei HK Cheong Fun,"Chanced upon this HK dim sum stall. Ordered beef cheong fun and steamed pork rib with black bean sauce. Especially impressed with the smooth, silky texture of freshly-made cheong fun wrapping tender, juicy beef slices - each bite is flavorful and heavenly!"
Chef Wei HK Cheong Fun,Best CCF I had. Located within the coffee shop. Every CCF is freshly made upon your order. I liked the char siew ccf ($4/plate) very much. The sauce and chili sauce are good. Will come back to try the you tew and other dim sum dishes. Quality is as good as restaurant and prices are reasonable. Better than Kimly Dim Sum. Recommended.
Chef Wei HK Cheong Fun,Chef Wei HK Cheong Fun legit! I would say it is better than some restaurants.  Love the Prawn Cheong Fun over the Char Siew one.  Follow reviewikr on Instagram and Facebook for more reviews.
Chef Wei HK Cheong Fun,"This awesome cheong fun is definitely your first choice of breakfast, afternoon tea selection in serangoon central area here. It is silky ,smoothly and refreshing when first bite taken. Sauce are clear and good, with their signature chilli together, this cheong fun is one of the best that i ever had before."
Chef Wei HK Cheong Fun,2 stars - Probably wouldn’t come back. Why don’t you try something with 3 stars?  Not sure if we ordered the wrong dish - you tiao Cheong fun. Cheong fun itself was fine - good texture. But the you tiao was overfried and rock hard.  Portion was generous for $4.  Open to upgrading this to 3 or 4 stars if other dishes redeem the experience during our next visit.
Chef Wei HK Cheong Fun,"Came across this stall and seeing that the customer flow was neverending. On top of that, it strongly stated that their Cheong Fun was ""freshly made""!!! So here I am~  Actually I was a bit early before 12pm to order the Mushroom Cheong Fun at $4. However, there are still more than 10 orders ahead of me. I got my order after a little wait.  Cheong Fun was pretty soft and a bit chewy. The soy sauce was a bit on the sweeter side, but it was quite tasty.The mushrooms matched pretty well with the plain Cheong Fun.  Besides that, the steamed Yam Cake $3 was quite firm, fragrance and savoury. Takeaway for $0.30 each."
Chef Wei HK Cheong Fun,"ordered these braised beef for $6.50. As you can see from the picture, the radius of the bowl is about the same as the plastic spoon, I can easily pick up the bowl using just my palm, no finger needed. The taste is standard and I finished it in a minute. Not worth for $6.50, the portion served is less than half of a standard meal"
Chef Wei HK Cheong Fun,"Waited 25 minutes for a plate of chee cheong fun on a Sunday morning :face_screaming_in_fear: unfortunately I didn’t think it was worth that long of a wait.  That said, the texture of CCF is definitely above average, and it was soft and somewhat melt in your mouth. I ordered the mushroom version, and thought they could have been more generous with the ingredients"
Chef Wei HK Cheong Fun,"HK Style CCF has been my childhood food. Strangely, one could not find a good one in Singapore for a while, except in highend restaurants that sell Dim Sums. Even then, they are not as good.  Chef Wei represents a whole new HK CCF movement in Singapore. It taste exactly like what I have eaten when I was young, and what I expected.  The CCF texture is usually done perfectly and the prawns are really fresh. The sauce is exactly what it should taste like which is closer to the taste of the olden days and in HK  Great food! Highly recommended  Edited 23 APR 2023: Ordered  2 plates this morning (1 char siew and 1 prawn); there may be some QC issues as the tastes changed, based on the following:  a. The CCF is much thicker, lost the usual semi-transparent and softness; a but tough to eat  b. The prawns are not well marinated as before; tasted blend  c. The soy sauce was more diluted than usual, resulting in loss of flavour; and the amount given was so little that it was insufficient.  I do not know if this is a cost cutting measure as this visit was the worse since we started eating  In view of such, I reduce the review to a 3 star review. Will go back again in a while to see if this is just one off or permanent.  Stay tuned"
Chef Wei HK Cheong Fun,Hands down our favourite cheong fun in Sg. Delicate folds of rice rolls steamed between large cloth sheets. We like the plain and the mushroom. They’ve now added delicious-looking Claypot rice options to their menu. Coffee shop is clean and airy and has good alternatives for those not eating cheong fun.
Chef Wei HK Cheong Fun,"Located in the basement of ION, not in the main food court but opposite KOI in Hawkers Street.  I wanted to like this place from the start. The idea of everything being made fresh rather than mass produced normally means better flavour, texture and quality.  That was exactly the case here. The Chee Chong fun was the best I've tasted in Singapore so far, and I've been to quite a few across the price range.  The service was very good, telling me about the different chilli's and ingredients used.  My only issue is the place has 4 restaurants so expect it to be a little challenging to get a seat, but most people are happy to share a table if you ask.  Dispite the seating, I would happily wait if needed, it was that good.  The price was also very fair for the quality."
Chef Wei HK Cheong Fun,"Ordered the Prawn Cheong Fun and pork ribs. The Cheong Fun is freshly rolled and made on the spot, so the wait was around 15-20 mins during lunchtime in the weekends.  The Cheong Fun was really smooth, sauce was great, and the chilli sauce was absolutely spot on. Great Cheong Fun overall. Price point is $5.80, slightly on the pricer side for 2 pieces, but still considered worthwhile for this quality.  If you are eating at ION Hawker Street, definitely order a Cheong Fun as a side."
Chef Wei HK Cheong Fun,"Sharing the menu for others to consider incase they want to have lunch here. Have tried the Cheong fun, plain and of char siew flavour and Lo Mai kai. It can get quite crowded during lunch time so good to go earlier.  There are a good variety of different Cheong fun in the menu, it’s healthy and tasty. Please continue the good quality food and introduce more mix of dishes to your menu. Thanks alot !"
Chef Wei HK Cheong Fun,"9 June 2023  We tried to order at 8.50pm and staff told us that it’s closed. Then when we were about to leave they accepted someone else’s order. We were understandably upset but we didn’t say anything but we were looking at the counter staff. Then the counter staff suddenly shouted at us which was extremely rude. After that I understood from the previous customer that her mum couldn’t eat other food and that’s why the counter staff accepted her order.  This I understand, but the staff chose to shout at us instead of politely explaining to us the reason why. The staff which is a middle age lady needs to learn to be polite to customers."
Chef Wei HK Cheong Fun,The cheong fun is crazily good! Soft and fresh in your mouth. Recommended
Chef Wei HK Cheong Fun,"On this second visit to this stall, the chef on duty was way more polite and nice than the one who served the first time. Even heard him repeating to himself what I requested for my CCF as he prepared it ! That was very conscientious of him, I thought.  However, if you prefer soy sauce that's not too sweet, don't let the chef add it, as it is more sweet than savoury."
Chef Wei HK Cheong Fun,One of the best Cheong fun in town. Texture is just right and the sauce is perfect. Can’t remember the Siew Mai taste. Surely no complain from me.
Chef Wei HK Cheong Fun,Ordered the plain cheong fun and the mushroom cheong fun. Nice texture and taste but the wait time is too long and the cheong fun was cold already. Also it is not vegetarian as the sauce has oyster sauce in it.
Chef Wei HK Cheong Fun,This Beef cheong fun has got the HK flavours.(SGD $5) Reminded me of the same taste profile as the beef balls dimsum I had from breakfast Yumcha place in Hong Kong.
Chef Wei HK Cheong Fun,"Newly opened dimsum stall in Tampines Blk 478's new coffee shop 'Happy Hawkers' (formerly Koufu). The CCF skin is thin and soft, made on the spot. Come try while the stall is still here!"
Chef Wei HK Cheong Fun,"The Cheong Fun is good however the custard pau is not acceptable (as per pic). The staff (aunty) their very attitude, not polite and keep telling us have to wait 20 mins bcox of the long order infront but in fact only got one grab order. In the end we only waited for 5 mins."
Chef Wei HK Cheong Fun,"Just grab Chee Cheong Fan here. Today. Ordered the mushroom, as I never try before. Service is quite fast considering they made them on the spot. Hong Kong style they claimed; I not sure. Please come and judge yourself. Overall to all, the food was nice , not too oily or salty. Cheers:smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes::smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes::thumbs_up:"
Chef Wei HK Cheong Fun,"First time trying the famed Chee Cheong Fun.  At $5, it’s fairly priced for the portion, though it’s somewhat of a restaurant price.  Taste wise is decent, really like how soft it is, and how fresh the overall vibe gives.  Will definitely consider ordering this to share when I’m here again."
Chef Wei HK Cheong Fun,Poor service. Auntie kept shouting to take tray to collect food when the previous person is still at the collection counter.  The radish cake barely look fried. It also look raw.
Chef Wei HK Cheong Fun,"Good Cheong Fun with friendly and humour stall auntie. I can eat this without going to THW. Price is common but taste and food quality is superb i would say in a hawker environment.  Managed to order being the last customer, $5 for a shrimp Cheong Fun, shrimp size is quite big and fresh! Soy sauce taste perfectly good, neither too salty nor too sweet.  Definitely will revisit soon!"
Chef Wei HK Cheong Fun,"Glad that their signature cheong fun is nailed at this newly opened outlet. I ordered the char siew version and it was freshly made upon order. The cheong fun is silky smooth and has the translucency and thin folds, showing how well it is executed. The cut pieces soak up the light and sweet soy sauce that gives it the restaurant-quality HK-style taste.  Additional sides such as the chicken’s feet and yam cake were also steamed to be heated before serving. Be sure to get a small saucer of the dark red chilli paste at the serving counter, it’s salty and spicy kick pairs well with the dim sum."
Chef Wei HK Cheong Fun,"Love the chee cheong fun here. They just opened, so i thought i give'd it a try. The rice rolls are freshly made and has a smooth, silky texture. The rice flour is definitely fresh. Once you put it in your mouth, you definitely can tell this was not made with old flour or frozen. Staff flood the dish with soy sauce and sprinkle generously with sesame seeds compared to other dimsum stalls.  Need come back and try the other flavours as well as their dimsums!"
Chef Wei HK Cheong Fun,"Liked their steamed rice, feels like eating at home. Like the concept of no need for fanciful utensils cause it can't be eaten anyways. :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes:"
Chef Wei HK Cheong Fun,"Can’t deny that the cheong fun tastes good but the service has to be greatly improved, male staff is pretty rude for no good reason."
Chef Wei HK Cheong Fun,"I tried the prawn cheong fun. The wait was quite quick, approximately about 10 minutes. The cheong fun was silky smooth. The prawns were also fresh -- it was still crunchy. The soy sauce was also good -- it was the sweet, instead of the salty one.  They also have variety of fillings for the cheong fun, which probably, I should try on another visit."
Chef Wei HK Cheong Fun,"Bought Char siew cheng fun. The cheng fun quite thin,  easily tear, probably need  a spoon.  It's not cheap by the way, for a char siew cheong  fun cost $4.80, which I think you can top up a little bit more for a complete meal, though.  But if you just craving for it and eat just as side dish or once a while.. is alright. I have better cheong fun and this is fair rating for me."
Chef Wei HK Cheong Fun,"Chef Wei HK Chee Cheong Fun @ HGM. $$ Order four portions already $30. Smooth cheong fun. Good packaging. Comfort food when hot and fresh and hungry! Light simple food anytime for a light meal.  The light soya sauce is amazing, not overly salty and makes the silky cheong-fun tasty. The whole packet can be confidently poured into the cheong-fun.  By far Mushroom and Prawn Cheong Fun are satisfying. Keep up the freshness.  Char Siew is not well marinated and roasted, not as fragrant as a char-siew should be . Scallop (most expensive) is definitively not value for money. Not worth ordering. Taste and freshness are both off. Dough Stick cheong-fun definitely a no go. Plain cheong-fun is too pricey as a carbohydrate.  Chicken feet is palatable. Pan fried carrot cake is not as tasty neither flavourful.  They should review their varieties and definitely can do better to improve their ratings across the outlets and with better service staffs. Your customers are hungry, tired (after work) and like to pack away happily for the costs they are paying."
Chef Wei HK Cheong Fun,"Always a treat to eat Chef Wei chee cheong fun. I have tried the prawn and the mushroom cheong fun and both were excellent. The light soya sauce complements the silky cheong fun really well, and is not too salty at all. Have patronised this stall several times already."
Chef Wei HK Cheong Fun,"Terrible terrible slow if you order take away,they anyhow jump orders.If u find it's too long better check with them if not they might miss out your orders without u knowing.End up they nv do your orders until u go check with them."
Chef Wei HK Cheong Fun,I've heard that the ccf here is nice so decided to try it out. I must say the ccf is really nice. However the service of the lady who took the order and handled the payment was absolutely horrendous. Two thumbs down! And she insisted she was not rude when her colleagues told her she was rude towards us. I probably won't go back there cos the lady with the poor attitude really spoilt the dinning experience...
Chef Wei HK Cheong Fun,"Ordered a dough stick (u tiao) chee cheong fun...when I bite it, the u tiao was like a stick. Not crispy but hard. Beware those with false teeth.   What a let down. I thought I can patronize the stall more often, but that is not to be."
Chef Wei HK Cheong Fun,"Order Prawn and Char Siew Cheong Fun, it is really soft and the fillings are nice. It is made upon order!"
Chef Wei HK Cheong Fun,"At 830 am, there is no Cheong fun. Food is nice but service is unreliable."
Chef Wei HK Cheong Fun,"Ordered 1 rice set, staff was rude,not wearing her mask proper and use her thumb to rub her nose before serving food to customer. Food served was far from picture, taste and look poor. Female Staff wasn’t sincere in serving customer at all. Boss should reconsider her or strengthen staff training."
Chef Wei HK Cheong Fun,"Somehow I think the prawn chee cheong fun taste better than the Bishan outlet. Soft and generous with their prawns. Perhaps the environment is more pleasant or the staff are more friendly. Simple words, ""慢慢走啊"", in fear of you spilling or dropping the tray, goes a long way for the dining experience, even tho' it's just at a coffee shop!"
Chef Wei HK Cheong Fun,"Average tasting chee cheong fun. Chilli was too oily. Carrot cake taste was not bad though, however the size of the 3 pcs were uneven and color inconsistent. It costs 30cents for a takeaway paper box which is too much. Better to bring own container as every item ordered has a 30cents takeaway surcharge regardless of plastic container or paper box."
Chef Wei HK Cheong Fun,Located in Chang Cheng coffeeshop at Blk 848. Freshly made HK style cheong fun upon order. The rice roll is silky smooth. Must eat while hot. Really gratifying.
Chef Wei HK Cheong Fun,"Food is good but they are obviously short of manpower. Busy preparing delivery orders and ignore dine in customers, who are left waiting to order for their food. Avoid peak hours (breakfast, lunch and dinner etc )."
Chef Wei HK Cheong Fun,"They are famous for their Chee Cheong Fun and my family love them. Personally, I love their Lor Mai Kai even more...very generous for the ingredients. Siew Mai is ok. Carrot Cake, Steam Tam Cake and Chicken Feet are good. Too bad that they don't sell prawn dumplings."
Chef Wei HK Cheong Fun,"Love the chee cheong fun, the texture is very unique and different from the usual ccfs in other places.  The steamed yam cake’s another hit, you can taste the yam and it’s not the cheap version mostly filled with flour."
Chef Wei HK Cheong Fun,"Decent sizeable handmade Hong Kong style Chee Cheong Fun. The cheong fun was soft and smooth; and thinly sliced. It went well with the sauce, which was light but slightly salty."
Chef Wei HK Cheong Fun,Always enjoy the food from this stall. Favorite local comfort food.
Chef Wei HK Cheong Fun,Prepared fresh on the spot.  The Prawn Cheong Fun ($5) has fresh prawns that still had bite.  The dough was light and thin and the sauce was lightly sweet.  Good.
Chef Wei HK Cheong Fun,"The male staff at ABC outlet attitude and service is horrible. No manner. Very unskilful communication skill. Just 2 small orders in front and he starts to tell everyone waiting time will be 30 mins. Chasing a lot of customers away. When delivery guy came to collect orders, he ask the delivery guy to cancel the order on his end. The delivery guy was puzzled and ask why. He says waiting time is 30 mins again. Although hiring is a BIG problem, Boss have to send secret customer here to check on the stall if not it might not be able to operate long."
Chef Wei HK Cheong Fun,Terrible service. Didn’t open on time. Said 7.30 am open but until 8am still not yet open. Even switch off the light by 7.45am. Lazy employee u got there. Shame
Chef Wei HK Cheong Fun,"The CCF is very nice , is very silky and smooth, and like their sauces but if can less sweet will be better. They also sell Dim Sum and Steamed Rice."
Chef Wei HK Cheong Fun,The service was great The food is also good :OK_hand:
Chef Wei HK Cheong Fun,
Chef Wei HK Cheong Fun,Very good. The cheong fun very slippery. Not bad for hokker food. Loved it will definitely go again. It seems to be a chain....the cooks are getting experience. Overall the quality and taste is good. It's right balance of rice flour and other secret ingredient. Takes time to experiment but I guess the chef knows.... vegetarian options available too. Mushrooms and plain. I hope more vegetarian options to come.  Next door is famous ban mien freshly made too
Chef Wei HK Cheong Fun,New branch at Serangoon. Tried the prawn Cheong fun. Sauce was just right not salty.Cheong fun texture was soft n silky.. Perfect for breakfast and teatime.
Chef Wei HK Cheong Fun,"Funny enough I was actually wanting to patronize a different CF stall in the nearby hawker center, but bumped into this bright and clean looking stall in a coffee shop. While I've recently heard alot of hype around how this stall start with an ex-Peach Garden chef, bla bla bla...I was never a fan of such marketing hyped-up establishments.  But I must say I'm pleasantly surprised by the quality of their CF. My order was freshly made upon order and I assume it's the case for everyone's else orders. The sauce and chilli was packed separately for my takeaway order and they were ample for a single serving. Both the sauce and chilli is perfectly on point and runs well with the steamed rolls. While I prefer my rolls a little thinner and smoother, this works well for me too. The shrimps were plump and fresh too, which added a crunch to my bite with the slippery rolls dancing on my tongue.  Don't get me wrong, I love what they did with their rolls but it's a pity my mind was still stucked with the other stall's CF in the vicinity. My only thoughts for this stall is to have a more friendly vibe upon ordering and maybe slightly cheaper? I still find $5 for their shrimps version is a little too pricey. Great job though, Chef Wei!"
Chef Wei HK Cheong Fun,Not bad. Long queue. No ePay. Had the $4 char siew. A bit sweet. Tasty. Nice new stall. Maybe try the :fried_shrimp: next time.
Chef Wei HK Cheong Fun,Freshly made on the spot and very good light sauce to go with the CCF. Above average.
Chengdu Bowl,"good place for gathering. The restaurant is cozy, clean and quiet. The food are all savoury. You will enjoy if you are a strong flavour lover."
Chengdu Bowl,"I recently had the pleasure of trying out Chengdu Bowl for dinner, and I must say it was a truly amazing experience. The restaurant boasts a small yet enchanting environment that instantly made me feel delighted upon entering.  The boss and staff at Chengdu Bowl were incredibly friendly and attentive, adding to the overall positive atmosphere. Their warm and active presence made me feel right at home, which is always a plus when dining out.  Now let’s talk about the food, particularly the Beef Tone Bowl, which quickly became my favorite. The delicious beef tone paired with fresh carrots, corn, and other delectable ingredients made for a truly satisfying meal. It’s the perfect choice for a satisfying and complete lunch experience, with just the right portion size in a single bowl.  I strongly recommend visiting Chengdu Bowl to all food enthusiasts out there. You won’t be disappointed! From the delightful ambiance to the friendly service and mouthwatering food, this place truly deserves all the praise. Don’t miss out on the opportunity to enjoy a memorable dining experience at Chengdu Bowl!"
Chengdu Bowl,"I had an amazing experience dining at the new Chengdu Bowl restaurant and I would give it a 5-star review. The flavors were truly authentic and reminded me of the culinary delights of Chengdu. The service was excellent, with attentive and friendly staff who made sure all our needs were met. The ambiance of the restaurant was pleasant, creating a comfortable and enjoyable dining atmosphere. The location is also very convenient, making it easily accessible for locals and tourists alike.  I must mention the standout dish, which was the Beer Duck. It was an absolute delight! The combination of tender and succulent duck meat with the flavorful kick of pickled peppers created an explosion of taste in my mouth. The duck was perfectly seasoned and had a delightful texture that was both tender and chewy. It was a true gastronomic experience that left me craving for more.  Overall, this restaurant is a gem for lovers of Sichuan street food. If you're looking for authentic flavors, exceptional service, a pleasant ambiance, and a convenient location, this is the place to be. Don't miss out on the Beer Duck, as it's a must-try dish that will leave you wanting to come back for more."
Chengdu Bowl,"Authentic Sichuan restaurant, beer stewed duck is my fav here:) Deep fried chilli chicken is also a must-try:face_savoring_food:"
Chengdu Bowl,"Chengdu Bowl is a true culinary gem for lovers of Chinese Sichuan cuisine! The warm and inviting ambiance set the stage for a comfortable eating experience. The menu offered a delightful selection of authentic Sichuan delicacies, and we couldn't resist trying the Beer Duck and Spicy chicken. Both dishes were the right amount of fiery spice. The attentive staff were knowledgeable about the dishes and graciously offered recommendations."
Chengdu Bowl,"The place is unassuming, but the flavours pack a punch. You cannot go wrong..we ordered the fish soup with a bunch of extras and a ton of accompaniments and sides. Everything was just brilliant and I highly recommend you visit this place."
Chengdu Bowl,"The food here is amazing. I love the sour fish (酸菜鱼) dish, it's the best one I've had and it's a dish I've eaten across many restaurants.  The fish is extremely fresh, and the price is a bit higher but you also get big pieces of fish. The small portion of the fish is enough for 2-3 people to eat.  I also love the cabbage dish which is made with pork lard and it's very delicious. These are the two dishes I get every single time I come here and they never fail to impress my dining companions.  Would absolutely recommend this place."
Chengdu Bowl,"Visited the restaurant on a weekday afternoon with my colleagues and we were given a table on the second floor. As we had gone there to celebrate the birthdays for two of our colleagues, we were served two items of dessert on a complimentary basis. Kudos to the 成都 staff for providing us with such a hospitable and memorable dining experience! Keep it up!"
Chengdu Bowl,"We ordered pretty much all the classic dishes on the menu such as double stir fried pork belly (回锅肉), beef with chili oil (夫妻肺片), hand sliced cabbage (手撕包菜), kungfu boiled fish fillet (麻辣水煮鱼), spicy chilli chicken (辣子鸡).  Overall taste is quite good but the spiciness has definitely watered down quite a bit to local taste, so we weren’t getting the heat we wanted.  Our favourite was the stir fried pork intestines which was also the spiciest, but the intestines was also cooked beautifully with nice bouncy texture.  Environment was nice and clean, and a good place for gatherings."
Chengdu Bowl,"Thoroughly enjoyed all the sichuan dishes which are also good value. I was recommended to the restaurant by someone from Sichuan who said that the food is very authentic. I am totally convinced after seeing the restaurant patrons. Besides good food, the staff are helpful and efficient. Be prepared to have mostly spicy dishes!"
Tomyum Mama,"Good Thai food at an affordable price. Had the Thai style wanton noodle (very cheaply priced at $5 base price), which was very flavourful. Added on additional pork collar for $1.70. Also recommend the chicken wings, fried to a crisp!"
Tomyum Mama,"Tom yum MAMA has the best claypot seafood tomyum MAMA! The serving is just right, the spiciness and sourness is just right! Their soup is their own recipe and always coming back for more! Have been introducing to my friends about them and they love it as well!"
Tomyum Mama,Simply yummy to the tummy! Ordered their signature Tom Yum noodles and it certainly lived up to the hype. Punchy and hearty Tom yum broth that trickles down the throat wonderfully. Will definitely come again for more.
Tomyum Mama,"Had lunch during lunch hour . Should order the signature claypot tomyum mama. The gravy is creamy with mild taste of coconut milk. Personally feel a bit overpriced for $15 instant noodle haha but apart from seafood , there’s some roast pork inside the claypot noodle too..the rest of the food is reasonably priced for the location. Every lunch meal come with complimentary ice lemon tea except for wantan mee menu..  papaya salad is good , fried chicken is super good - recommend to order , prawn cake - so so . The condiments and chilli condiments is free flow lol.."
Tomyum Mama,"I went to try tom yum soup with seafood, the taste was ok but can be better not that really authentic. The serving portion quite big and very nice decorations.Value for money for the size.Staff are friendly and service is quick.They have multiple branches I would try also."
Butter Bread,"Small little cute bakery in Midpoint Hougang (Inside the mall). Tried their croissant, I feel ok, the butter not as fragrance. They do also sell tart and other savory pastry. One of the better bakery in the neighborhood."
Butter Bread,Quaint little neighborhood bakery with the friendliest staff!! I got the most interesting pastry which was the garlic cheese croissant - it’s a kouign amann style pastry stuffed with fluffy cream cheese and with crispy garlic and parsley bits sprinkled on top. The right balance of umami and it was so good that I finished it in one sitting!! Will be back for more next week. They also have sourdough on the weekends.
Butter Bread,There wasn’t much butter taste in their croissant. Tried the other pastries and find that you can get much better ones elsewhere. Not so much hype about it though
Butter Bread,"Rode my PAB from pasir ris to visit this shop. Bought their crossiant,  scone and chocolate cake. Crossiant is of pretty shape and nice flaky layering, hmm taste is not out of the ordinary. The chocolate looked very moist and dense through the plastic packing. Once opened, it has this nice chocolaty smell. Cake is quite light not dense as i tot and sweetness is just right. Have yet to eat the scone. Might go again to try other items."
Butter Bread,"Was around the vicinity and was attracted to the dough and smell of baked goods. Gotten the original sourdough and the lemon tart for $17.50 Have yet to try the sourdough; the lemon tart is tart and tangy with a sweet shell, it’s to my liking. The only thing is the diameter of the tart base somehow bigger than the depth of the box so the a tiny bit off shape but the flavour is more important to me. The place sells croissant, pain au chocolat, hot coffee, tarts, cake loaf etc. They usually open from 1.30 till sold out but Google shows till 5.30pm so you can try call before dropping by. Saw mixed reviews on the croissant so would love to try it out next round. Will be back again."
Butter Bread,"nice ambience when you wanna enjoy your me-time, various menu, good service. i ordered oreo cheese cake and ice matcha latte. those are nice but suprisingly not my cup of tea. maybe should buy another menu to explore. i asked for takeaway cup and they give it for free. super recommended"
Butter Bread,"Pretty much a weekly affair with the family after Taekwon-Do training! Pastries and bread taste really good, and I really enjoy their hand made butter. The seasonal Christmas bakes were amazing, I regret not posting this review sooner!:grinning_face_with_sweat:"
Butter Bread,"This is the only “cafe” in the neighbourhood really that is walking distance. Competition is springing up here and there but the owners and servers always have very positive attitude and really do their best to provide high quality experience. I like their ham & cheese a lot (grilled is more expensive with the sourdough, but their soft buns also fine). Coffee quality is consistent, but also very home-feel.  My wife enjoys the Nutella cake for dessert.  Sorry, no pictures."
Butter Bread,"Tried their chocolate croissant, egg mayo croissant, cheesy butter thick toast and iced chocolate. They all tasted great and at affordable prices. The cheesy butter toast was particularly thick and delicious, with generous amount of cheese! The owners were extremely friendly and it's a great place to hang out on a chill day. Will definitely visit again!"
Butter Bread,"This is a my favorite bakery. Breads tastes Japanese like bread, not too sweet. Shop staff are very friendly. Their butter is very yummy too! I love their traditional sour doughs, brioches and bugettes. Children must be carefull for Tuna bread. That was a bit spucy."
Butter Bread,"Bread and Butter is a small, charming cafe that delivers a cozy and inviting atmosphere. Despite its limited space, the cafe manages to create a warm ambiance that instantly puts you at ease.  Their selection of baked goods, while not extensive, is worth a try. Although I found the brownie a bit too sweet, it might appeal to those with a sweet tooth.  The coffee though is where they truly excel. I tried the hazelnut cafe latte, and it was a perfect blend of rich flavor and smoothness. The baristas demonstrate a talent for crafting great cups of coffee.  One drawback is the cafe's early closing time at 4pm, requiring customers to leave by 4.20pm. Additionally, due to limited seating, it may not be suitable for long sessions.  Despite these limitations, Bread and Butter is a cozy spot to enjoy a quick coffee break or catch up with a friend. With friendly service, tasty coffee, and a charming atmosphere, it's worth a visit. While the baked goods selection could be expanded and sweetness levels adjusted, the overall experience is delightful. For a short and sweet cafe visit, Bread and Butter is worth considering."
Butter Bread,"Excellent service-Attentive, thoughtful, personalised. Quality ingredients freshly baked by owner. Bought a sampler of all bakes available on that day for a party & my guests loved them all, the treats were gone in 60 seconds!! Definitely one of my fav coffee on the go places. My personal favourites were the Smoked salt Brookie & Yuzu cake,friends loved the Brownies & Assorted Buns."
Butter Bread,Happy to find Bread & Butter! Came here on a Saturday and they serve freshly made banana bread. I’m happy they are open on a weekend! The owner is very kind too. Cheers!
Butter Bread,"A place where you can find great pastry, cinnamon rolls, and cookies! You shouldn't be missing out on coffee breaks in Bread & Butter and chat while admiring its pink decor.  Staff are polite, food are worth the value. Their cold brew will definitely keep you awake."
Butter Bread,"I love this shop!! I am always tempted to get something every morning whenever I walk past the shop. The owner and staff are so friendly and you can see that they are very passionate and love what they do. Good vibes only :smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes::smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes::smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes:  The bakes are SO DELICIOUS and completely worth the money. My favourite things to get are the pistachio and yuzu pound cake (it’s the yummiest pound cake I’ve ever eaten), gula melaka pound cake, truffle and cheese bread roll. I would recommend buying the whole loaf because it’s so good! You can preorder and collect it :)"
Lawa Bintang,Fantastic fresh cheese lobster ($22) with sotong & egg ($9) makes a happy meal. The lemak comes fragrant basmati rice & powerful chilli enhance one’s taste bud. Can return to eat.
Lawa Bintang,"The Lobster Nasi Lemak was delicious! The melted cheese and herbs made the lobster so enticing and the taste was marvelous. The nasi lemak set also came with fried egg, peanuts, anchovies and the lovely sambal chili. There could be a  queue during lunch time, so going earlier or later would shorten queue time."
Lawa Bintang,Best nasi lemak in Singapore. The lobster and the coconut-y rice are the best part.
Lawa Bintang,"Wow wow wow!!! Absolutely delicious nasi lemak, the spiny lobster was cooked perfectly, the rice was aromatic and flavourful, the ikan bilis crunchy and not overly salty, the sambal was a delicious blend of sweet/heat and such great service, will be back for sure! Worth the trip from Sentosa!"
Lawa Bintang,"The lobster is not huge but it’s fresh and done well! Not over cooked at all! Still moist inside and comes off the shell easily!  I went for the motherload and order my lobster nasi lemak with a side of chicken wing, bergedil and Otah for about $24-$25.  Of course it’s not something you eat everyday but I treat myself once in awhile over where on the small wins in life."
Lian He Ben Ji Claypot Rice,"I made my order at 7:50PM and I got my claypot at 8:23PM. Not too bad to get my order just half an hour. Being Michelin Guide 2023, the wait might be longer for some.  Don’t forget to elevate the flavors by mixing the luscious black sauce and fragrant oil to your liking. I prefer mine to have a generous drizzle of black sauce.  The charred rice at the bottom of the claypot adds a delightful crunch and smokiness to every bite."
Lian He Ben Ji Claypot Rice,This is the classic place for Claypot rice; the queue here is very long (waited for 70min) since they made the rice to order using real charcoal.  They don't use precooked rice.  The charr was very nice and the salted fish inside is the cherry on the cake.
Lian He Ben Ji Claypot Rice,The food is very delicious and very affordable. 15 SGD worth of mixed claypot rice can feed 3-4 people. The claypot rice was cooked perfectly. It is really worth the wait and worth the hype. The employees were very approachable and very kind. They even helped me perform first aid to my partner and helped me find the nearest hospital that offers 24/7 emergency consultations since it's already late at night. Thank you so much Lian He Bin Ji :white_heart: We will definitely come back.
Lian He Ben Ji Claypot Rice,"Love the rice and the meat of the claypot!  Perfect balance between hot and tender. Chicken meat was also done well.  We spent ~$40 for 4 people (2adults + 2 kids). Price is very affordable.  We went during rainy day and we sat around the railing. Because of that, the pipe was leaking near where we sat.  Recommend to sit nearer to inside if it is raining."
Lian He Ben Ji Claypot Rice,Went there to try this stall out since it will close for business soon. Waited for 2 hours before the claypot rice was ready. First impression of the dish was that it was nothing special. Mixed the ingredients with black sauce and oil before eating. The rice was bland and low quality. The chicken and the other ingredients tasted ok but not exceptional. There are many other good claypot chicken rice in Singapore. Won't miss this one for sure.
The Beef House,Only giving it 4 star because of the queue... 5 star for the beef ball and sliced beef! Noodles were still nice and chewy after bringing it home for lunch:beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes:. Probably even better if eaten at the shop.... Next time will try the traditional Hakka  soon kuey and snacks!  Be prepared to go early to catch the snacks.... They usually finish selling those at about 10~11am....operating hours from 7am to 5pm or when all ingredients are sold out.
The Beef House,I’m Hakka and I grew up not liking Abacus Seeds (算盘子) because the ones I ate growing up were really wet and mushy. I actually like these a lot - the flavour is amazing (mushroomy!) and the texture is great too. I love their Hakka Yong Tau Foo - the meatball with the oyster inside is always my favourite. My parents always tell me this is one of the last remaining places that sell soon kueh that use actual soon (bamboo shoots) - most other places use turnip (cheaper). The staff can be quite intimidating - they sometimes quibble with my dad (he’s Hakka) as banter hahaha Still looove the food and the place though - super charming.
The Beef House,"Yummy homemade Hakka style yong tau foo, abacus seed, beef tendon balls.  If I’m alone, I usually get noodle dry I’ll add my own sweet sauce and chili later. A bowl of yong tau foo request uncle to give me bittergourd coz I love it, and add in some beef balls.  Line can get long, go early! Yong tau foo sells out fast. They have soon kueh too which I occasionally will dabao."
The Beef House,"Enjoyed a good start of the day with delicious traditional Hakka delicacies - Beef Balls, Yong Tau Foo, Abacus Seeds and Soon Kueh from two stalls located side by side in the same coffeeshop. :chopsticks:Assorted yong tau foo were stuffed generously with fish and meat paste prepared from scratch and hakka noodles topped with minced meat ($4 per serving) were qq and so perfect with their special chilli. :chopsticks:Beef balls soup ($5) with beef balls made from 99% beef and only 1% cent cornstarch were plump and juicy with fascinating texture. The accompanying clear soup was flavourful and comforting. :chopsticks:Abacus seeds ($2 per serving) were packed with fragrance of steamed yam and each bite accompanied with minced meat and dried shrimps gave the extra satisfaction. Yam lovers must definitely try this. :chopsticks:Soon Kueh ($1 each) was packed with flavourful fillings and the skin had a satisfying chew.  Do visit early for good variety of ytf and availability of food as they are sold out pretty fast. Hurry down to try these delicious Hakka food and you are guaranteed to leave with satisfied tummies after your meal. Any fans here?"
The Beef House,Went to have noodle soup at this humble-looking stall located in Jalan Besar area.  We ordered their beef ball soup with dry noodle. The soup was just a clear soup but the beef balls were huge. The noodle was good and chewy.  However their seating area is quite narrow and there wasn't enough fan to keep the patron cool when the weather is humid right now.  Price is SGD 5. Will come back again just for the food.
Breakfast Hola,"This is the best taiwanese food I ever had in Singapore. Their food are more close to local taste bud, slightly salty and more flavourful. Every time when I think about breakfast, it will come first in my mind.  Their braise pork rice and egg crepe roll are the must to try when you visit the store. Its very packed when you come during breakfast hour, around 9am - 11am.  It is in my favourite list and definitely will come again and again."
Breakfast Hola,"Have been here several times. Like to frequent Breakfast Hola because it reminds me of Taiwan. They serve an excellent 蛋饼 (egg crepe) with cheese. I have tried it with pork floss and with corn. All are excellent! The crepe is crispy and tasty, and generously filled with ingredients.  The (台湾锅烧) Taiwanese nabeyaki (seafood) is also recommended. It includes a special crispy noodles, a prawn, lala, pork slices, meatball, crabmeat and romaine. The soup has a unique fragrance and although it is addictive, the soup is a tad bit too salty.  Have tried their sandwiches too. Also generous with ingredients, but I'm not too fond of the sweet mayonnaise sauce that is spread on the bread.  The coffee, soy bean and tea are great too.  Small cafe and you might not get a seat during peak hours. The servers are efficient though.  Wish the prices were a little lower, but overall still worth frequenting."
Breakfast Hola,"Eatery near Maxwell station, next to Indian temple. On Sunday was packed with customers, managed to get a table of 2. Ordered Lu Ru Fan 卤肉饭 (comfort dish) with add on set of corn soup and soy milk. Added scallion pancake 葱油蛋饼 (love it) & Good morning milk tea!"
Breakfast Hola,"Both dishes I had were quite decent. 1. Original egg crepe roll with scallion oil skin - one of the best I've had in Singapore. 2. Braised pork rice - overall combination (braised pork, fried egg, pickled cucumber and rice) is above average compared to other Taiwanese braised pork rice dishes I've tried in Singapore."
Breakfast Hola,"It is a lovely small restaurant, clean and bright inside. We took two egg rolls (corn and pork floss), both are very good, just wish they can use better quality of pork floss to enhance the taste. Also, we took one big portion of Taiwan style minced pork rice, taste is not bad, but its not very authentic as it comes with fried egg but not braised egg.  If you fancy some Taiwan homemade food, I do recommend you to come and try."
JOFA Meepok,"Soso food terribly impatient staff. Shook head when we were ordering – probably understaffed and overworked. Just for the hype, not worth the effort to try unless you’re nearby or you dont want to join the prawn noodle queue next to it."
JOFA Meepok,"Have been patronizing them frequently (meepok is one of my favs) and first time encountering such rude staff at the counter (young-ish guy with higher pitched tone in spectacles). Said hello a few times to get his attention to order, but was ignored and he walked further in so I said hello louder. He told me he already heard me and that I should wait, not sure why he couldn’t acknowledge me when he heard me earlier.  The uncle behind me was also waiting for quite a while and got told off when he finally tried to order at 8.50+pm, saying that they close at 9pm and he should order earlier."
JOFA Meepok,"Love the mix of ingredients. Noodles was alright, chilli was quite spicy (my spice tolerance quite low) but fragrant. Need to travel a bit If you don't stay around that area"
JOFA Meepok,"Inconsistent ingredients in every order. Especially want to mention about the fried fish stick in my takeaway bowl of mee pok. Sometimes it’s 1 piece ,Sometimes even worth don’t have a single one with the lady worker. Hope the seller do something about it. If not the food is nice can give more stars"
JOFA Meepok,"It was quite tasty, the soup is super salty! But overall worthy of it's taste and price. Not sure why not many Q, but the pork rib prawn noodle next to it was long Q though. Young men owners were affable and friendly. Worth a try!"
JOFA Meepok,"For the price of $13.50, there was definitely some expectations plus i actually tried since I seen xiaxue raving about it. I reached around 6pm and there was only 1 staff. He was busy frying stuff for the western food options and took my order for noodles while informing that I had to wait for a while. I was damn annoyed when he took my order as he kept frowning. The best part is he frowned again when I requested for no meatball and guess what? Check the photo :face_with_tears_of_joy: he was the same guy who made my noodles but I think he may not be supposed to be the one, maybe he just took over cos his colleague was not there... Anyway, scallop is not fresh, fishball is standard factory made type, soup is a weird diluted msg taste, soft shell crab was hot but batter is very thick, and noodle texture is poor. I would say if you really like bak chor mee (No. 25), go to next block 161 stall during day time the young couple makes amazing bcm you won't regret."
JOFA Meepok,Went around 2pm on a weekend and there was no queue. Chilli is a bit too spicy for someone who can’t really take too spicy food but I imagine someone who loves spicy food will find it quite nice with the springy noodles.
JOFA Meepok,"This is probably the most expensive meepok I’ve ever had, but I just couldn’t resist not trying their 𝐏𝐫𝐞𝐦𝐢𝐮𝐦 𝐒𝐞𝐚𝐟𝐨𝐨𝐝 𝐌𝐢𝐧𝐜𝐞𝐝 𝐌𝐞𝐚𝐭 𝐍𝐨𝐨𝐝𝐥𝐞 ($13.50) :grinning_squinting_face:  It came with premium toppings, like abalone slices, prawn ball, pork slices, minced pork, crispy soft shell crab, tobikko and clams.  Overall, it’s a good and satisfying bowl of meepok to try though it’s quite a splurge for a hawker food :face_with_tongue: so I won’t buy it repeatedly.."
JOFA Meepok,"The premium bowl came with soft shell crab, tobiko, onsen egg, clams and scallops on top of the usual bam ingredients. Enjoyed it! Also the texture of the meek was so good and bouncy. Good for that occasional indulgence, if not the regular bowl is good enough. Will be back to try their fried sticks!"
JOFA Meepok,"This is a good bowl of Meepok with premium ingredients - at $13.50 it's really quite reasonable considering that most ramen places will cost you more than this.  Pros: - the meepok is a very solid bowl of meepok even on its own, without the other ingredients. - ingredients are generous: soft shell crab, clams, (faux?) abalone, tobiko - and they all enhance the flavour.  Cons: - the shells on the clam broke off for me before I even started eating, which made for an unpleasant experience with accidental clam shell ingestion / trying to get it out - it's in a rather small coffeeshop - the drinks stall nearby is priced much higher than regular drink stalls at hawker centres. portions at the drink stall are also not huge."
JOFA Meepok,"Really one of the best meepok I've tried. The meepok noodles itself is not overcooked or undercooked it's like just nice. The chilli is spicy but it's really shiok. I love the fishball though, doesnt have that fishy smell or taste and its bouncy and salty. Overall it's really good. But it's like normal meepok la but the texture of the noodle is better than normal!! Should really try it. I tried going to the store and dine in and also ordered delivery. I usually hate delivery food cause dabao food is always not that nice. But this meepok still taste good even its dabao. Love it.  Also tried their prawn paste soup. There's nothing special about it though. The meepok is still like the main lead."
JOFA Meepok,"Overrated! Came across influencer’s stories on Instagram. Decided to travel all the way there just to try it out. JOFA meepok with meepok SOLD OUT. Prawn paste taste like fish cake. Portion was stingy even noodles, seafood doesn’t taste fresh. Overpriced. Also experienced excessive thirst after drinking their soup."
JOFA Meepok,"Very simple, unassuming bowl of meepok which i thoroughly enjoyed. Ingredients were fresh and generous, soup is flavourful. Will definitely be back again. :)"
JOFA Meepok,Came across this store around the area where I stay & decided to give it a try. Noodles are cooked well and has a springy texture to it. The chilli was mixed well with the noodles as well. Ingredients were value for money. Will definitely come back for more!
JOFA Meepok,"The meepok is well cooked, especially love the unique texture of the noodles. The prawn paste has a very nice bite to it. Would definitely visit again!"
Numb Restaurant,"This Chinese restaurant is a hidden gem! The modern Sichuan style cuisine delights with bold flavors and generous portions. The ambiance is delightful, offering a pleasant dining experience. Highly recommended for anyone craving an authentic taste of China in a charming setting."
Numb Restaurant,The food is yummy especially the mashed pepper with century egg and eggplant. It's ladies' night on Thursday. Order a main dish and the lady gets a complimentary beer or wine. I got the Asahi.
Numb Restaurant,The food is really delicious and environment is comforting. Let have a dinner and drink after the works with friend. Highly worth for recommended to all especially Sichuan dishes lover.
Numb Restaurant,"The meat of the roast duck was so tender and juicy, I highly recommend it. There was also a less spicy option which you can go for if you are a non-spicy eater. The chicken is also so so good. The place was fully packed on a Friday night!"
Numb Restaurant,"Taste of food is very good , however, portions for some dishes were rather small though ...resto can consider giving Regular/Large option for all dishes instead of selected few. The prices of vege dishes are quite ex in my opinion, given the sad quantity served. Their supposedly private room , not that private as the ""doors"" are not doors; the private area is separated from the main dining area with a curtain, so people sitting outside can hear conversations being held in the private dining room. Service staff are accommodating and polite."
YAO YAO Sauerkraut Fish,Super fantastic fish! You must really give this a try if you enjoy 酸菜鱼! The red bean cold jelly dessert is extraordinary..love the bursting flavours of tea and red bean! The service staff here are also very friendly and welcoming especially Edmund! Thank you for this wonderful experience! :smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes:
YAO YAO Sauerkraut Fish,"The signature sauerkraut fish was average, soup lacked spicy numb flavour, kind of sour. Dessert (Rainbow Cold Jelly) and Glutinous rice roll were good. Thumbs up for that."
YAO YAO Sauerkraut Fish,Nice food and good service! Perfect rice:cooked_rice: Hope they will have bigger table to serve more people in one group.
YAO YAO Sauerkraut Fish,"Visited this newly opened Sauerkraut Fish in Vivo City recently. Understand that it has over 60 outlets in China and is an award-winning Sauerkraut Fish one-of-its-kind concept that serves both suan cai yu and Peking Duck under one roof.  We tried their Signature YAO YAO Sauerkraut Fish which is cooked with super tender sliced California White Seabass alongside sauerkraut that has been fermented for 24 days.  Overall the food here is nice and I really like the cyan-coloured theme decor and their cute Mer-bear mascot!  From 7 – 9 August, you can enjoy 58% off Yao Yao Sauerkraut Fish for 2 persons ($20.20, U.P. $48) when you dine in to celebrate their opening and Singapore’s 58th birthday!"
YAO YAO Sauerkraut Fish,Service was good but the fish needs to be placed over a stove or something as people eat. It was already served lukewarm. got cold super quickly and became virtually inedible….
The Flying Pan,"Located inside a kopitiam at block 703, Hougang. A half-stall, offering a limited variety of grill items. Understandably, because the stall is only manned by a lady and a gentleman. Their item prices are ""unbelievable"" ... Chicken Chop, Pork Chop, Chicken Cutlet at only $5.50 ... includes 3 side dishes of your choice. Ribeye Steak is at $7.50 + 3 sides. Check out their FaceBook to know their opening or closed status, as they do not have a fixed schedule. Advised to go earlier, as the Q can be long, waiting time of more than half an hour. As we were hungry .. I only remembered to take photos after 2 mouthfuls ... hahaha ... pardon the ""untidy"" 2 photos ...."
The Flying Pan,"A small half stall that I missed the first walk through and thought maybe there's another coffee shop in the same block. Some popular stalls here, so seats are at a premium. Came 11.45 and only one sharing table left. One harried guy manning the stall, to cook and man the register, so prepare to wait a bit. Was the food worth waiting for? Good quality, good quantity, at a price point that feels 20 years ago! Portions feel smaller than the pix I've seen, sides fairly plain, so maybe they've cut some corners. Still, where else can you get a steak for the price of a Big Mac meal? Will come back to try the other dishes."
The Flying Pan,Really good price and you can choose 3 sides of your choice. Went on a Saturday evening and they are sold out at 730pm. 2 chicken wings for $2.50 and the stall offered 3 instead because the wings were small that day. Small gesture but appreciate it.
The Flying Pan,"Long que during peak dining hours, large portions for the low price. Plenty of side dishes to choose from but they do run out fast. The food was ok but was drenched in black pepper sauce. Overall pleasant experience."
The Flying Pan,"A hidden jem at Hougang Ave 2 coffee shop.  Its opening time is 11.30 am  When I was there at 11.30 am, there was already a queue forming.  I ordered: Chicken Chop with fries, mac & cheese, and baked beans Chicken Chop with aglio pasta, coleslaw, and mashed potatoes Pork Chop with aglio pasta, coleslaw and mashed  The taste and quality were above average with good side portions - all for $5.50 each -  it was well worth the money.  Two thumbs up :thumbs_up: :thumbs_up:"
Yakiniku Hero,"Will be back for more! Good quality and wide selection of beef cuts, chicken is also nice and tender. Chilli and sauses for the grill meats are perfect, not overly salty. Owner/staff are friendly, offered good recommendation and sincere service :clapping_hands: We order another set and end up over eating.. that how much we enjoy it :smiling_face:"
Yakiniku Hero,"Nice setting for a kopitiam. Plenty of ventilation, sometimes wind so strong the fire keeps getting extinguished. Ordered several diff cuts of pork and beef. The star is the karubi imo. $5.80 per 100gm is quite value for money. Meat is tender and has a nice fat to meat ratio. The pork jowl has this slight sour taste which i suspect might be freshness compromised. Staff was very apologetic and nice enough to refund us even though we say no need. Overall a pleasant experience which i will probably return in future!"
Yakiniku Hero,"Excellent place for grilled meat. Affordable and value for money. All cuts were juicy and tender. The boss also super friendly and nice guy.  Since open air, after grilling clothes wont smelly.  Came because of Mikey Chens vlog. He wasnt wrong!  Highly recommended!!"
Yakiniku Hero,The star of the show are the beef cuts. Karobi and skirt steak are nicely marinated. Don’t go for the miso soup rice set though - you get food served in paper trays that are devoid of taste.
Yakiniku Hero,"First time here on our usual Saturdays outings, n we loved it. Friendly bros at the stall, as usual we ordered what we love, enough to fill our tummy 70%. 3 meat n one veg n rice set was good enough. We are small eaters so we ate slowly n savour the well seasoned meats, pork jowl was slightly tough, premium karubi was great (4 piece), can’t remember the other dish name but it was beef n ok too. Damage was $43.00 for two. Can’t be happier. If you are around in Bedok. Recommended to try (meat eaters please haha)"
Eightisfy Western,Say first- was contemplating to give 4 or 5 stars. But gave 5 stars anyway.  classic chicken chop (no sauce): $7.30 with huge amount of fries. beans and coleslaw. chicken grilled decently (maybe a bit dry). 8/10. worth so u can get this  pork lard carbonara: $8. me myself dont like to eat carbonara in general. I am quite biased. but i think i didnt get amazed by the carbonara too much. Its alright one. 7/10. but adding pork lard is quite interesting.
Eightisfy Western,"Tried this western food stall located in the coffeeshop located inside the bukit merah industrial area.  Place is pretty accessible, it’s just a 5 mins walk from the nearest bus stop at the main road. Reached the place pretty late and there was barely anyone except a handful of diners. Apart from the western food stall that there a few more other stalls that were operating.  Other than the standard western fare, they also sell pasta. Prices for the food starts from SGD$7 onward.  I ordered the classic chicken chop (no sauce) which was SGD$7.30. I didn’t had to wait long before my food was ready. The chicken chop came with sides of fries, coleslaw and baked beans.  Chicken was nicely grilled,it has that charred taste to it. They were very generous with the portion of the side dishes, huge portion of fries that I almost couldn’t finish.  Overall, the food was decent and their pasta seems pretty decent as well. I wouldn’t mind giving it a try the next time round I happen to come here again for dinner."
Eightisfy Western,"This place definitely deserves more recognition!! This has got to be my favourite hidden western gem located in an industrial canteen. Came here twice and left thinking what to eat for my next visit :face_with_tears_of_joy: Pro tip: if you come on a weekday evening and the chef offers you their special : YOU MUST TRY IT!!  I was fortunate to have the chef‘s special tomato beef meatballs with Nonya style bread and the truffle gnocchi. Cmon man! Where can you find such restaurant grade quality food in a food court?? The meatballs were juicy n the sauce had a perfect balance of tomato n garlicky aroma. The truffle gnocchi? I thought I was at an Italian restaurant because it tasted so fresh n good! (Hand-made btw)  We also had their grilled fish which was delicious too. All in just over $30/-. Super worth it!!  Did some googling and found that the humble chef owner used to work at a renowned Italian restaurant ( explains the superb quality of the food!! )  Must try for sure!! I rarely write reviews but this place definitely deserves more recognition man! I previously had the carbonara and pork chop and those 2 blew my mind too. ( both under $10 each ).  By the way, I know I sound super enthu but I’m not sponsored to write this. I’m only doing it because it’s so damn good and want more people to try it!!"
Eightisfy Western,"Been frequenting Eightisfy Western @eightisfywestern for their old-school Western fare! Generous portions at affordable prices - what more could one ask for? ⁣ Their Garlic Chicken Chop hits all the right notes for BB. The slab of chicken was well seasoned and relatively fork-tender, but the MVP is the brown sauce with its savoury & garlicky oomph. The fixed sides of coleslaw and baked beans were also decent, though you get to choose either rice or fries as your choice of carbs. If you prefer a richer flavour, go for their Black Pepper sauce instead.⁣ ⁣ Considering that it's in a kopitiam setting, don't expect guanciale or pancetta in this locally inspired Pork Lard & Bacon Carbonara. That being said, the copious portion of crispy lard cubes and bacon did well in elevating the flavours of the cream sauce. The poached egg also adds that extra gooeyness to the noodles. My only gripe was that it's missing a slight touch of black pepper that would have made it less one-dimensional in the flavour department. Aside from that, it's an indulgent treat perfect for carb lovers!⁣ .⁣ :round_pushpin: Address: Maddox Canteen Bar, 3752 Bukit Merah Central, Maddox Canteen, Singapore 159848⁣"
Eightisfy Western,"Superb fusion bacon and pork lard carbonara with a runny, jiggly egg on top. Generous portion size and value for money. I liked the ambience of the place and hope to come back and try other menu items like the fish and chips. Compliments to the chef!"
Rasa Sayang Western Food,"Location - Accessible but requires a short walk from the bus stop.  Ambience - nestled in a coffee shop, new and clean place.  Prices - value for money!  Taste great! Chicken cutlet doesn’t taste greasy although fried. Chicken chop is grilled well, juicy and tender!  Although there are many customers, the speed of orders fulfilment is applaudable, because of the good processes the uncles and aunties have."
Rasa Sayang Western Food,My son enjoyed his meal. I loved my chicken chop plate! We all took different dishes and they were all very delicious. No wonder Rasa Sayang has been around for decades!
Rasa Sayang Western Food,"Pork Chop for $8 was such one big meal for lunch. The meat,the bean,potato fries,they all were delicious. I just don't like pickel vegetable with mayonnaise. It didn't fit into my taste unfortunately"
Rasa Sayang Western Food,"Coffee shop environment but the food is good!  Chicken chop - good flavor, has some smokey grill taste. Fries not bad  Chicken cutlet - large size! crispy and meat is ok not too dry. But when eaten together with the other 2 with mushroom sauce, feels dry.  Ribeye steak - stall did medium rare properly, nice! Does will with the mushroom sauce too.  Overall good, will visit again!"
Rasa Sayang Western Food,"Amazing experience. I feel like my tongue doesnt want to taste other food after feeling the tenderness and juiciness of the steak. 100% recommend their chicken chop pasta. AND THE GOD DAMN CHEESE FRIES THEY ARE SO GOOD GO TRY THEM NOW THEY ARE WORTH EVERY CENT YOU SPENT, EVERY BITE BRINGS YOU TO A WHOLE OTHER LEVEL AND EVERY BITE YOU FEEL LIKE YOU ARE LEVITATING AS IT TASTE LIKE HEAVEN RAHHHHHHHHHH PS the people are friendly and provide great service"
Gogiyo,"Food was generally okay. The fried chicken was very crispy and tender, tasted quite well with the mentaiko sauce and the egg. The rice was, however, hard and lumpy. Had a difficult time mixing the rice and the ingredients together with the disposable utensils. My jaw also felt quite sore after eating. Ramyun tasted average, like every other korean eatery. The service staff was quite nice."
Gogiyo,"Came here to eat with friends after reading the reviews on social media. We ordered a stew and a bbq set but the portion does not seems to be enough for 5 pax. My friends and I felt that the food was not up to hype as well. Positive thing was, if you are still hungry, there are other stalls to try out as it is located at a food court. And afraid that I could not get a table, the staff actually helped to reserve a table for me. Appreciate their help with it."
Gogiyo,"We have tasted various locations. We enjoyed The GoYiYo(Toa Payoh), value for money. Most essential of all,, this outlet is extremely delicious amongst all the Korean BBQ. Ample parking and good for family gathering. Must visit and taste. Eric Lee"
Gogiyo,This is the 2nd time that we went back to this outlet cause the food was good and the service was good. The tobboki didn't taste plastic or instant at all which is pretty good. Their rice bowls are surprisingly good too. Worth the visit if you are nearby for quick korean food fix!
Gogiyo,"Service provided by staff Zhiying exceeded expectation. Even though he was short handed and busy, he was jovial and polite. His smile lights up the whole food court. It was an awesome experience. Meat is well marinated and portion is generous. Value for money. Will definitely come back. Food court even has a great variety of beer. Perfect match for Korean bbq.

Two Bake Boys Cafe,"Cake was delicious yet not so sweet! The crepe layering increases the depth of the flavour, as it's not your usual cream-based cake. However, would be better if the price could be lower as a single thin slice of the lotus biscoff cake cost $8.90."
Two Bake Boys Cafe,"From friends' recommendations, I ordered the Thai Green Milk Tea Crepe for brother's birthday and we love it! Can taste green milk tea from both cake and sauce, not too strong and tasted just nice. Best thing is it is not sweet yet still tasted so delicious, can totally feel the love and hardwork when baking this cake. Delivery was on time despite heavy downpour and appreciate the delivery updates when I enquired via Whatsapp. Will definitely order again and recommend to friends. Keep up the good job Twobakeboys:flexed_biceps:"
Two Bake Boys Cafe,Ordered Tiramisu cake 2 days before birthday and was able to collect cake on time. Was given some packed chocolate sauce for the cake as staff said cake it’s not too sweet (which is good). chocolate sauce is packed separately to drizzle on cake  in case some guests may prefer sweeter taste. We like the cake and will order again. Service good and prompt respond when ordering via what’s apps.:thumbs_up::thumbs_up::thumbs_up:
Two Bake Boys Cafe,Had their blueberry cheese muffin to go. It's good! Soft muffin with cheese filling. The staff was kind enough to entertain my order even though he's in the midst of closing.
Two Bake Boys Cafe,"Ordering was easy, the service offers via WhatsApp was quick and made my last minute order stress free! Beautiful cake and presented beautifully. Daughter was thrilled As she wanted a crêpe cake for her birthday, but she did not expect such a pretty cake with rainbow icing ."
Ms Maria And Mr Singh,"Actually, I had assumed Ms. Maria and Mr. Singh is a humble Indian restaurant whenever I passed by it, until a few days ago, I received an email announcing set menus at this place and it out an emphasis that it is a Mexican and Indian fusion. Wow, that sounds very interesting since I have never heard of such fusion, and I actually like both cuisines (though I prefer contemporary Indian cuisine over old school one). I decide to just take the plunge and try out the food here.  The food here is so good, tending more towards contemporary Indian cuisine with bits of Mexican flair and sauces. The full-bodied taste of the food is unique and simulating.  The decor is an unconventional mix of the grandeur + florid designs of Indian architecture and the sunny, colourful, free-spirited embodiment of Mexican culture. Intricate tiles, Taj Mahal inspired entrance, bar counter with colour lights, windows of different bright colours, straw lamps, long stretch of chiffon floral cloth and neon lights, all these actually work well together to radiate that posh yet fun feel, with a cultural vibe.  The service is excellent, they are so friendly, efficient and such great conversationists. Totally enjoy myself in such great company.  Papdi Chaat is a great beginning since lots of harmonised flavours are showcased in this nifty creation. The yoghurt sphere explodes in the mouth to reveal creamy, tangy goodness, perked by the subtle touches of Indian spices. Worth a try.  My favourite got to be Ceviche Cold Curry Scallop. Served in a cold claypot, the fresh, plump, briny sweet raw scallops taste sublime when paired with the avocado, paper thin cucumber and the special light milky sauce peppered with Mexican goodness.  I never think that scallops can go well with curry because the strong spices of curry will usually overwhelms the subtle sweetness of the scallops. But this Ceviche Cold Curry Scallop totally overturns this assumption by going light on the creamy spices feel of Indian curry and incorporating the sharp, clear spiciness of Mexican cuisine instead.  And it works wonderfully. The nuanced flavours of the scallops can actually come through the spiciness of the sauce. I love this.  Taco Pork Vindaloo is served with the Mexican sauces of salsa martajada, salsa diabla and salsa taquera. All the sauces really tease the palates, elevating the rich taste of the juicy pulled pork. Five ways to enjoy this dish (by itself, with lime, and with the 3 kinds of sauces) and I love it.  Chicken Tikka Masala is more Indian than Mexican, featuring succulent chicken coated with rich, creamy curry that holds lots of goodness of the spices. I wipe the plate clean of the curry with the prata and nice fluffy bread with crispy surface. Since the curry is very strong in flavour, eating this with the carbs actually balance the flavour.  The Churros is nice, but no exactly the best I have since I prefer those with souffle interior and crispy coat.  However, it is delicious when paired with the Sticky Rice Ice-cream that imparts the moisture to the churros and soften its exterior. I also like the light earthy flavour of the ice-cream.  Thoughts: So fun and good that I want to come again and again."
Ms Maria And Mr Singh,"This was a fantastic experience. My partner and I had the tasting menu and every dish served to us was delicious. As we sat at the bar, the bartenders took the time to explain all the dishes to us, and even the history of the dishes!  Portion-wise, it was just nice. It was filling but we didn't feel stuffed - a perfect balance. We thoroughly enjoyed the food and ambience at the restaurant."
Ms Maria And Mr Singh,"We enjoyed our lunch with margaritas here. Recommend : fish main dish, the chips with guac and tacos. The combo of Indian and Mexican is palatable and appetizing with the bold flavors."
Ms Maria And Mr Singh,"Was a bit worried when I saw some negative reviews here. I booked the place 2 months in advance so there is a lot of anticipation.  The staff were helpful in giving recommendations. We had the okra fries and fish tacos to start. The okra fries were full of flavor and fried really well. Really enjoyable starter! The fish tacos were interesting but honestly is a dish we probably can do without in our meal. Only because we also ordered the fish tamal, which is also local barramundi. The sauce was really addictive. It is not too spicy, a little tangy and flavor is not too overpowering. That's a great balance! Our favourite had to be the surf biryani and crab curry. Very impressed by the quality of the seafood in these dishes and the balance of the flavours. Cocktails were also good - we had the banana old fashion and margarita. Both has an interesting spin to the classic drink.  Water is $3 free flow as other reviews mentioned. You're gonna need that though given the spices used in the dishes!  Overall, a great experience. Food, service and atmosphere did not disappoint. Casual and enjoyable evening, would recommend!"
Ms Maria And Mr Singh,"Tried the prefix set menu. The food was average, some of the dishes were underwhelming. Did enjoy the seafood briyani. Our dining experience was made less than pleasant by the drunken, loud and pottty-mouthed diners at the next table!"
Western Barbecue,"I don’t remember the chicken chop to be so “under-charred” lol. Though still nice and tender , I think the fried chicken chop fair better. Also I prefer the usual fried burger bun western food always give than the one they have here. More like cake texture. I always end up not eating / bring home as breakfast."
Western Barbecue,"Hidden gem in the hawker center. Their chicken chop is really old school in taste, the sauce is more flavorful nostalgia tomato with garlic sauce. Chicken cook to charred hence meat is still juicy and tender. Their side dishes served are also good (fries, coleslaw and soft bun). It’s a busy stall as well, need to queue for your order during busy time."
Western Barbecue,"I have tried most of the dishes on the menu and the meats are cooked well. There is a pleasant charred taste on the outside while the juiciness of the meat is retained. Most items come with French fries, coleslaw and a piece of bread. Overall, a good and value-for-money Western meal in a hawker centre environment."
Western Barbecue,"It had been some times since i last ate their pork chop. It still as delicious as before, especially with the garlic sauce and the pork chop is really tender. :face_savoring_food:"
Western Barbecue,"Beef Steak (SGD $11) @ Western Barbeque. . Since 1974, this stall has been reowned for their hearty Western fare, served with a house secret garlic sauce that is equal parts sweet savoury spicy in taste, with a piquant note. Makes everything addictive. . The beef sirloin was done till medium, with a tender moist chew to texture, and natural meaty savoury salty flavour, picking up the gravy well. . I like that the crunchy chilled coleslaw is light on mayonnaise, so you get the bright natural vegetal sweet flavour of the vegetables (cabbage, carrot). The thick English crinkle chips are fluffy with starchy salty flavour. . The old-school cream bun is pillow soft, rather like a cake, with a thin layer of cream within. Has bready milky sweet flavour; works as a dessert. . . . Chicken Chop (SGD $6.50) @ Western Barbeque. . What makes this great is the marinade rub on the chicken. . They serve a traditional cut of chicken chop, with bone-in, a rare sight these days. The chicken is thick, tender, and juicy with a light chew, carrying meaty savoury salty sweet smoky flavour. . Completed with a fresh crunchy coleslaw with vegetal sweet notes, crisp crinkle potato chips with starchy salty sweet flavour, and a soft old-school cream bun with bready milky sweet notes."
Ye Lai Xiang Tasty Barbecue,"Known of this western food stall within Maxwell food centre, read up on an online article that they were previously from Margret drive food centre, this stall is well known for their generous portion of western food. Reached there around noon on the weekday and was greeted by the long queue. Most of it were takeaway orders. They offered they standard hawker western food fare like chicken cutlet, fish and chips etc.  I ordered the chicken chop which was SGD$9.50, slightly higher than elsewhere but justified by the portion. Waited awhile before my food was ready. The chicken chop comes with the side of fries, bun and coleslaw if you didnt wanted baked bean, The chicken chop was nicely grilled, and drenched with the gravy which was slightly tangy and sweet.  Overall, enjoyed the food. Would love to try their chicken cutlet the next time round as i noticed many people ordered that."
Ye Lai Xiang Tasty Barbecue,Chicken Cutlet. Hainanese Style western food that only operates during meal times on weekdays. Their popular items are their cutlet with its special sauce though I would say I am not a big fan of their mixed vegetables.
Ye Lai Xiang Tasty Barbecue,Large generous portion of chicken chop. Taste great and reminds me of the old style western food that we all love. Stall is also easy to find (facing outside towards Maxwell Road) and near the center. Worth a try!
Ye Lai Xiang Tasty Barbecue,"Finally got to try the Western food after so long. Went on a Friday evening and there was a queue when we reached. Auntie taking order was friendly and took orders in advance to cut down the waiting time. After 30 mins of waiting, we got our chicken chop and chicken cutlet. For $10 a plate, the portion is really big and value for money. For someone who does not like to queue, the food was worth the wait and did not disappoint me."
Ye Lai Xiang Tasty Barbecue,"Well I think the stall lives up to its name, its pretty tasty and well portioned. Might be abit more expensive than the rest if the hawker stalls but I think its worth it. Was there for lunch, long Q but service was quick"
Geylang Lor 29 Hokkien Mee,"I have eaten a few times before Covid. It was a respectable plate of fried Hokkien mee and what I remembered vividly was that the portion was not very big. Fast forward a few years and after having savoured the same dishes from various places, I still think this really quite good.  It has a very prominent wok hei and charcoal aroma - obviously so as it is charcoal fried. The noodle is so smooth and tender that makes eating very easy. Instead of doing two plates of $8, I went for the $15 portion for sharing. I am quite surprised it has five crunchy jumbo-sized prawns. It may appear expensive for a hawker dish, but honestly it’s a lot of hard work and a piece of flavourful art after decades of working on it day in and day out."
Geylang Lor 29 Hokkien Mee,"The best Hokkien mee I’ve eaten. The Smokey taste from the charcoal, to the huge prawns.  They close very early. Like before 5pm. So make sure to go early if you wanna try it."
Geylang Lor 29 Hokkien Mee,"Been wanting to try this very long but havent been around this area for a long time. Finally had the chance to since I was nearby decided to drop by and try. Arrived around 4pm and guess I was the 1st customer. I ordered and he didn't immediately prepare but I waited quite a while for it. During the wait I could see big fire so I guessed he was in the midst of cooking something already. While waiting could also see more and more people coming to order the noodles. I didn't wait long before I was called to collect and pay for the noodles. Firstly when I saw the plate of noodles I was quite disappointed with the portion. For a price of $8 for the smallest plate, it was a bit too steep for that size, I wished it was slightly bigger. In terms of taste, definitely one of the better prawn noodles I have eaten. This is not my kind of prawn noodles because I generally prefer the thick beehoon and wet kind, while this is the thin beehoon and more dry kind, it was still acceptable for me. The chili was one of the highlights of the dish as I thought it was also pretty well made. 4 prawns was quite decent for a plate, but definitely won't visit again because it's too expensive. There's better and cheaper ones around."
Geylang Lor 29 Hokkien Mee,"Not worth it in my opinion. I'm at 2.5 stars as I feel that this isn't a 3 star. Firstly, the smallest plate is $8 for this amount of portion and it is a HUGE rip off. I finished my plate in 13 bites which didn't make me full. Secondly, I really don't get all the hype. Yes sure they used chives and had the crispy lard which was quite different than the typical Hokkien Mees I eat but the taste of the noodles and sauce didn't complement well in my opinion. The prawn scent is very strong and chilli tasted decent which was a plus point. The taste of the noodles were not to my liking even with a lime. This dish is a real miss for me and I have eaten many hokkien mee better than this. Overated"
Geylang Lor 29 Hokkien Mee,"If you arrive when they finished serving up a batch you have to queue 15+ minutes while the next batch is prepped. A lot of time is spent tending the charcoal flames. End result is a smoky charcoal plate of fried hokkien mee, one of the best in town. Picture is the $10 option with generous portion of prawns firm to the bite. A relative runs a branch on East Coast Road that also sells oyster omelettes."
Geylang Lor 29 Hokkien Mee,"This charcoal-fried Hokkien Mee is a delightful explosion of flavours and textures. The dish is rich in moisture and cooked to perfection, infusing every bite with a satisfying wok hei essence. The prawns are juicy and fresh, adding a delightful crunch to each mouthful. Although the dish is prepared in large batches, it maintains its consistency and delectable taste. The wait for a freshly made batch can be a tad long, but trust me when I say that it's worth the wait."
Geylang Lor 29 Hokkien Mee,"I had Hokkien mee two days in a row. Today is the second day, and this was very impressive. I loved how it wasn’t too wet or dry, chilli was good thought a little too spicy for me. The blend of ingredients contributed to the overall perfect balance of the dish! I enjoyed the Beatty road Hokkien mee yesterday, and today, I really enjoyed this charcoal fried Hokkien mee. Will be back for more!"
Geylang Lor 29 Hokkien Mee,"First time trying this stall and I really like the Hokkien mee! It's rather pricey at $6 for the smallest portion, but considering that it is charcoal fried (some wok hei taste) and there are a number of sotong and prawns, I think it is worth the price. They cook by batches so you may need to wait for some time if your order requires a new pan of mee to be cooked. Or you could be lucky and score a plate within 10 minutes :grinning_squinting_face:"
Geylang Lor 29 Hokkien Mee,The hokkien mee with the chilli will be worthy. Open air concept. Chilli is hot but weather is hotter.
Geylang Lor 29 Hokkien Mee,"Worst dining experience. Strongly not recommended. When i was paying for the hokkien mee, was promised v fast and only need to wait 10mins. In totality i waited 30mins and its not because theres alot of ppl in the queue thats why the long wait ( if thats so im fine). But instead he will forget about those that have paid and are waiting for the food and give them out to ppl who joined the queue later on. Invest in a queue system for god’s sake"
Geylang Lor 29 Hokkien Mee,"The saviour of this dish is the combination of fragrant sambal chilli and umami-infused prawn broth with the noodles. The ingredients used are relatively fresh, though my noodles were a little over cooked and soft. It is still delicious for non-fussy eaters. Get the $6.50 portion if you are hungry, as the $4.60 option is a little small."
Geylang Lor 29 Hokkien Mee,"Tldr: For the price of $6.50(medium), it is not cheap hawker food. It does its job of being a fried prawn noodle, though tons of room to improve on.  Taste wise, it lacks any form of lard or prawn taste. It taste rather bland and watery, perhaps due to abit too muay beansprouts. It has a slight charred taste here and there which I appreciate, but other than that, the taste has nothing to rave about.  Noodle is okay. A standard stir fry noodle/beehoon mix, although too much liquid in the pan when frying I suppose, as some turns out a tad too soft as compared to a truly 'fried' noodle texture.  Quantity is absolutely too little. 3 prawns is acceptable but the serving itself is not enough for an adult male.  The one nice thing going for them is the chilli which adds flavor to the noodle. It really does save the noodle quite a bit.  Probably wont return again for the price, quantity and taste - unless I just want to satisfy the fried prawn mee craving."
Geylang Lor 29 Hokkien Mee,"Standard cannot compare to when they were operating at Geylang , furthermore was not hot and prawn not fresh. Previous two times brought from them during peak period , the noodle was hot. The very last time I brought from them was during off peak period , noodle was not really hot."
Geylang Lor 29 Hokkien Mee,$4.50 for fried hokkien mee (small) and $6.50 for next size. Standard price but small serving on small plate. Should have an increment of $1. Taste wise still lacking in the wok hey. Wet version with a tad much bean sprouts and 2 x  prawns. No sotong nor the fried park lard. Over cooked due to large cooking in large serving and not easy to control the heat and time. Lack of taste and standard for a good hokkien mee. Overall it's nothing to shout about and unlikely for me to  revisit.
Geylang Lor 29 Hokkien Mee,"taste is okay la but i never eaten hokkien mee add so many egg shells extra into my noodles before. not even joking, today i eat, every 3 mouthful will have a HUGE piece of eggshell, felt like never ending. just when you think you got rid of all of the eggshells and can enjoy your meal, bham another surprise. not pleasant at all."
Geylang Lor 29 Hokkien Mee,"Avg About 3.5 stars. Texture: Wet and soggy version Combi: yellow noodles + thick white bee Hoon.  Nothing super special, consider pricey. Came on weekday mid noon, thus no queue. $6 version has got 3 prawns. Taste wise, just something is missing. Chilli is not sambal version, kinda watery.  Carrot cake was not bad. $6 with 3 prawns too. Again, there’s no matching chilli to go with."
Geylang Lor 29 Hokkien Mee,"Hadn't been here since the founder passed away late 2022. It's also hard to find parking in the evening and they tend to close early by 8pm. The hkm is especially salty tdy, not much work hei and prawn umami not as evident as before. As for the orh lua, also tended to be saltier but the oysters are plump and juicy. Overall can only say standard has dropped."
Geylang Lor 29 Hokkien Mee,"Fried Oyster Omelette (SGD $6) @ Geylang Lor 29 Hokkien Mee. . Their rendition is delicious, with equal bits of potato starch and egg, crisp chewy fluffy in texture with lovely smoky eggy savoury sweet flavour. . The oysters are medium and juicy, lending a briny salty sweet note, while crisp parsley bursts with vegetal herbal sweet flavour. . The lime infused chili has a mild sour spicy kick, not overwhelming."
Geylang Lor 29 Hokkien Mee,"My honest review..  The ingredients are the reason why the price is at higher side..  The prawn and squids are legit good..  However, the broth used for frying hokkien noodle was plain taste.. the colour is there, but the taste and fragrance still not there yet..  Sambal good"
Geylang Lor 29 Hokkien Mee,"Geylang Lor 29 Hokkien Mee sets the gold standard for me. The first time I had Hokkien Mee was a homemade version prepared by a friend, and it was absolutely delicious. For the longest time, I mistakenly thought it was prawn mee, as I had never tried either of them before. Consequently, I started eating prawn mee, thinking it was Hokkien Mee. But once I realized my confusion, I became a Hokkien Mee aficionado or, dare I say, addict.  My second encounter with Hokkien Mee was right here at this spot. I stumbled upon it while walking around the area and was immediately drawn to the long queue. Intrigued, I decided to give it a try. Little did I know the reputation and history that this place holds within the Hokkien Mee culture. Nevertheless, I was hooked from that moment onwards. Due to the consistently long queues, I usually opt for pick-up or delivery. However, no matter how the food arrives, it always tastes amazing when enjoyed at home.  I have yet to come across a better Hokkien Mee, but I'm on a quest to find one. Until then, Geylang Lor 29 Hokkien Mee remains my reliable and go-to choice."
Ah Hoe Mee Pok,Mushroom mince pork noodles were cooked to perfection. The pork broth soup was simply irresistible. Pretty decent for $6. Q can be long at times…. Worth the wait.
Ah Hoe Mee Pok,"A leveled up mee pok noodle dish. It's like being served two dishes, and that's why price is also a bit higher. The noodles are more on the tougher side, and not much in the serving but one can always ask for more for free."
Ah Hoe Mee Pok,"Short fast moving line during this lunch hour.  Mee pok seemed thicker and wider than usual. Retained good bite and texture. Very mild noodle sauce that doesn't stand out. By default, neither spicy nor vinegary.  Soup not the usual porky intense rich type, instead sweetened with loads of vegetables, pork slices and prawn. Their house special chilli is a refreshing chicken rice chilli style dip.  Rather ok overall. $6 for a small portion was kind of acceptable, given the size of the large prawn. Doesn't warrant the special trip out here from my end of the island though."
Ah Hoe Mee Pok,Personally I love the soup and the prawn meat I ordered more than the Mee Pok noodle. Haha! :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes: The soup was robust with full of flavours! Lots of veggies and minced pork in it!! Prawn paste meat was soft and tasty too! The soup itself already won my heart and i will definitely go back again just for it.
Ah Hoe Mee Pok,"Came at 10am to a queue of 7 that stretches to the entrance of the coffee shop. The wait was about 15 mins tops, and I ordered #5.  There were 2 slices of fish maw with plenty of ingredients! I was a little surprised by the abundance of it actually.  The broth was extremely rich! I loved every mouthful of it. The noodles were quite little for its regular portion, but I saw you could request for additional noodles without extra cost. The texture of the noodles were really springy."
Yong He Eating House,"If you like some simple authentic Chinese food, this is the place to go for. The soya bean is original, you can taste the bean. There are no sugar added so you may adjust the rate accordingly"
Yong He Eating House,One word: disappointment Been eating at their food since childhood and I witness slow death after moving to their new location. They have certainly totally lost the title of “king of beancurd”.  This visit will be my last after giving them one chance… what can I say…they do not have the heart to maintain their name anymore. I should give them a one star…but I gave them another star because it’s our comfort food over 20+ years
Yong He Eating House,"Overall only average, however the beancurb still acceptable taste and the texture smooth. The drink plain taste. The mee sua better go to Taiwan for the real good taste . :face_savoring_food::winking_face:"
Yong He Eating House,"Authentic Taiwanese cuisine. Food wise, not so good, it had a thick layer of oil for my porridge, probably from the minced meat. Little portion of century egg even though its called century egg porridge. Large portion of meat, so those who like meat porridge, it'll be great!  Ambience definitely needs an overhaul. Cashier looks fierce but is actually very kind and helpful."
Yong He Eating House,"Got to know this place from a friend who ate since he's young. But the standards have dropped. Still not a bad experience.  Food to order: *Soya milk (add sugar on your own) Fresh and good. *You Tiao Mochi was good but too oily. *Mee sua not too bad but not oysters, it's big intestines.  There's salty bean curd, I personally still prefer sweet ones cos it's minced meat in it.  The carrot cake wrap w egg wasn't too bad but too oily too.  The crepe wrap w floss starch was really thick. Not recommended for that.  Otherwise the rest are still acceptable."
Yong He Eating House,"Far cry from the real 永和豆浆, doesn’t taste anything like it. Bland taste of food and lack of aroma soya bean, just like a normal soya drink.  Price - overpriced Food - average Cleanliness - good Location - good Staff - good"
Yong He Eating House,We bought a braised pork + lao you tiao set & peanut butter + lao you tiao yesterday & I would rate it a one star for both the food & the drinks.  Cold soya bean milk was a tad on the sweeter side & very diluted.  The shao bing was so HARD & chewing it is like a workout for my jaw muscles! The lao you tiao was also super hard & not crispy nor fragrantly fried :confused_face:  The shao bing is probably from a central kitchen cause all the staff did was to heat it up & paired it with the pre-prepped food ingredients such as braised pork + veg / peanut butter.  The peanut butter also melted off when it was added onto the hot shao bing & the peanut butter just dripped down to the plastic bag & I was literally just eating the plain shao bing.  The packaging was also in plastic bags (storing hot shao bing) :expressionless_face:  The portion is really filling (& affordable) BUT there's no sense of satisfaction after eating the food :pensive_face:  I wouldn't recommend this stall to anyone.
Yong He Eating House,"Take out only. Ordered floss with egg + you tiao topping It tasted quite average and felt kind of dry, but I guess it's better than being too oily :face_with_tears_of_joy: The warm soy milk has no sugar :thumbs_up:"
Yong He Eating House,Didnt try to food menu but ordered the drink. Too sweet to my liking.
Yong He Eating House,"Love the floss + egg shao bing. Don’t miss the soymilk, simply awesome. Soymilk is rich and good!  Follow “ReviewIKR” Instagram and Facebook for more reviews."
June Bakery,Google for egg tart and found good reviews for June bakery. The shop is located at The Plaza B1 managed by an elderly couple. They sell traditional egg tarts as well as special egg tarts like Yam/ pumpkin/ blue berry etc. The crusts were a but too sweet. Price is quite reasonable.
June Bakery,"Located at a very quiet building. Just 10mins walk from Nicoll Highway MRT station.  There were so many tarts available during the weekdays (I visited on a Wednesday). Finally got my hands on these tarts as I read positive reviews about it.  Got their Yam, Sweet Potato, Peanut Mochi With Yam and Cheese Tarts! Each of it costs $1.50. It is so affordable!  I wish they were located somewhere conveniently access to the public and open on the weekends too :crying_face:  Auntie and Uncle are friendly too! :smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes:  I wonder those tarts that are available on the day are already pre-ordered in advance :thinking_face:"
June Bakery,"I started buying the tarts here when they cost $1.20 each, but now the cost of each tart has gone up to $1.50, but it is still super good value for your money.  To date, I haven't come across a bakery that sells cheese or orh nee tarts below $2 but this humble little bakery has been doing that and surviving well all these years.  I love their tarts, and they are in no way inferior to their more expensive counterparts.  If eaten fresh, the filling is creamy and not overly sweet. And the orh nee and sweet potato tarts are topped with some gingko nuts. The other item worth trying is the big mochi which is coated with peanut, it is soft and 'stretchy' and I just love the texture. As for my kids, they simply love the cheese tarts.  You have to be early because some of the items will be sold out after 11am.  If you are early enough, they also have buns on the shelves but limited quantity.  The elderly uncle and auntie who run the stall are pretty friendly and patient too.  Give their tarts a try if in the vicinity, you will not be disappointed."
June Bakery,"Tucked inside the quiet The Plaza (B1 level), this local old school bakery is a hit with the office workers so be there early cos’ they are usually sold out by lunchtime! They sell a few varieties of baked tarts, the most popular being the Orh Nee (yam) tart and others like Cheese Tart, Chocolate Tart (not Ganache), Sweet Potato Tart, Portuguese Egg Tart and even Muah Chee (glutinous rice cake with peanut bits). The old couple has been running this business for years, and it’s good to see them still so friendly and selling good bakes!"
June Bakery,Always sell out fast. Can call in to check before heading down or go in the morning to grab your favourite tarts. Posting a past pic of goods from June Bakery. The orh nee yam tarts are pretty yummy. Attractive price points. :smiling_face_with_heart-eyes:
Taste of Home,An artisan noodle with meticulous preparation and presentation. Hence got to give it some to prepare. Taste wise the noodles are ok. The vinegar pork knuckles is one of the high quality like home cook style. If you are passing by why not. But yo make the way specially for this .. :thinking_face:
Taste of Home,Pig trotter with vinegar ($7) is ok.  Price is slightly higher than expected but given the amount of effort needed the price seems decent (if the taste turns out to be good).  The sauce is very tasty to pair with rice. Meat is tender but after eating for some time the oily taste is too much.  Overall this is ok to pair with rice and for sharing.
Taste of Home,"Seriously under rated excellent dishes. It will be criminal not to try if you come across this. The boss is a decent chap who deserves lots of love and support :red_heart:.  Coffee here is not the nanyang type, so will avoid. Coffeeshop atmosphere, when in luck, u sit under/near the fans."
Taste of Home,Hidden gem serving hard-to-find dishes like Lai Fun. The pig trotter vinegar is one of the best I’ve tasted! Run by a friendly & earnest gentleman offering great hospitality. Highly recommended!
Taste of Home,"I am biased because I am from Seremban, but I am not “Sek San”. Enjoyed the lai fun for lunch, that I tahpau-ed back the sotong mee hun and another Lai fun for the wife. Enjoyed the texture of the Lai fun and sotong mee soup. Shared with my Seremban friends in SG!"
Taste of Home,"This humble stall selling Nasi Lemak, economical noodle and bee hoon and laksa is helm by a relatively young chap!  Its one of the go to places for breakfast for me. Usually I will order the Set A which consisted of the well marinated fried chicken wing and the sunny side-up $3SGD. Their laksa is also highly recommended!"
Taste of Home,"There are many Nasi Lemak stores around us but finding this one here, is truly the crème de la crème of Nasi Lemak.  Not only was it affordable at $3, there are plenty of ala carte to go with and their Laksa.  Their nasi is fragrant and each grain has the coconut milk in it. They are soft and flavourful. Now if you're trying their Nasi Lemak, it would be a crime if you don't try their chicken wings and chicken cutlets. These are specially handmade by the young chap behind the store. The tumeric are locked in between the meat and the skin, every bite packs a punchful of flavour.  Lastly, the chilli here goes so well with their Nasi Lemak. It's not too spicy, with a tingling bits of sweetness and sambal, the chicken cutlets and chilli are a match made in heaven.  總之，你請自下來嘗試是不會錯的!"
Taste of Home,"Was looking for breakfast on a Saturday morning at Fengshan food Market at 8.15am  Saw the queue was pretty long and wondering :thinking_face:, should be delicious?  Well I joined the queue.  It was pretty fast to be my turn.  My sides sides to choose from with your main if you do not want standard set.   I brought my fried beehoon  with noodles and 3 sides.  The wok hey of the beehoon and noodles reminded me of the old days.  I liked it.  Will go back to tru laksa and nasi lemak as I saw many people eating these two mains too."
Taste of Home,Delicious Nasi Lemak at Bedok. Crispy fried chicken and good to go with the sambal. The seller is very friendly too!
Taste of Home,super delicious and worth the money. probably one of the best nasi lemak and laksa in Singapore. highly recommended! must try!
O Happi Place,"Waffles with ice cream, dark chocolate, and bonbon, as well as hojicha paired with cereal milk. The hojicha's aroma and the cereal milk's flavor perfectly complemented each other. The waffle was light & crisp."
O Happi Place,"Hidden gem in Everton Park. Clean & cosy environment. Yummy yet affordable dessert. Flavour we tried: mango &pineapple sorbet, ondeh2, butter caramel crunch. Will be back for brunch next time. Very friendly & humble owner."
O Happi Place,Small and cozy ice cream place. Love the interior design here. Tried the Earl Grey Orange and Lychee Rose Raspberry and I really like how aromatic these 2 flavours are without tasting artificial. We didn't order the waffle/croffle but they smelled really buttery when then crew was preparing it. Will come back to try other flavours!
O Happi Place,Found this random ice cream place on google map and decided to give it a try. Overall ambiance resembles a bit like Bird of Paradise. I like the decor and it can be a place to chill of you are around Outram Park area. I ordered Salted Gula Melaka since it is always my go-to but a bit disappointed about it. It is just sweet and very sweet. Not the gula malaka sweet but normal sugar sweet.
O Happi Place,"This is one of my favorite gelato cafe with its wide range of novelty gelato flavors, enjoy most of the flavors i tried, some interesting flavors such as Coconut with Kaffir Lime taste a little like tom yum :grinning_squinting_face: The Clean and cozy environment makes it a great place to hang out :smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes:"
